00:02:14 [W] Hello.
00:07:39 [W] Hello, I believe we're live.
00:07:41 [W] Go hello.
00:07:46 [W] Hello.
00:07:46 [W] Hello.
00:07:46 [W] Hello. All right, so good to you know, I see everyone at Cube con this year, you know as is tradition.
00:08:00 [W] we will be doing our Toc panel at Cape Cod, which essentially is an opportunity for people to meet the TOC cncf staff and folks would basically kind of make the project, you know project aspects of the organization work behind
00:08:07 [W] Behind the scenes. So to kind of kick things off.
00:08:18 [W] My name is Christian has like I had the fun job currently serving as CEO and Co the organization but I played many roles from executive director janitor sales and so on for the organization, so it's been fun to see it grow over time.
00:08:26 [W] We have a subset of the eleven Toc members today for the panel.
00:08:32 [W] will go introduce them and give them an opportunity to you know, discuss a little bit about their background and so
00:08:39 [W] on in the cloud ew, bol.com
00:09:01 [W] Hello, my name is Alina prochik.
00:09:07 [W] I work for apple as a part of the field engineering team and I helped various Apple team with a the adoption and making their first half stream contributions prior to that.
00:09:19 [W] I've been a part of Rancher labs and I've been involved with open source Community for more than 10 years happy to be here.
00:09:24 [W] Awesome.
00:09:25 [W] Thank you Lena. Next on my list.
00:09:28 [W] I have Justin Justin Cormac. Hello.
00:09:32 [W] I'm Justin Commack.
00:09:36 [W] Thrown into this container space and that's kind of how I got involved in that.
00:09:48 [W] I'm also I'm a major on the notary project and I'm sure a lot of time working on security. So I work with cncf security Allah as I'm
00:09:57 [W] I spend a lot of time working on security. So I work with cncf security Allah as I'm the liaison there and I've been working with them since before it was set up.
00:10:05 [W] So I've been involved there and I'm really interested in all the security projects that are appearing in cncf, but I also have an interest across other things with containerd E kubenetes and all the other exciting things that your your old building.
00:10:16 [W] So, thank you Justin next on my list Katie.
00:10:22 [W] Hello everyone.
00:10:29 [W] My name is going to come on G and I'm one of the club but Engineers for American Express.
00:10:32 [W] I've joined American Express quite recently actually just healthier. However, the purpose of my teams to be disruptive and to introduce some of the new practices some of the best practices actually within the cloud knative space historically a previously I've had
00:10:44 [W] Solid experience with the increase of companies and actually being part of that Spectrum.
00:11:00 [W] So another batch of being elected as an inducer Toc as long as I'm here to kind of bring that on to view and make sure that we have the end users in mind when we crafting the cncf landscape.
00:11:04 [W] Also, thank you Katie.
00:11:09 [W] I'll is rice. Our Toc chair is is up next.
00:11:11 [W] Hi.
00:11:11 [W] Yes.
00:11:13 [W] I'm this Royce.
00:11:16 [W] I look after open source engineering at Aqua security.
00:11:20 [W] So like Justin, I'm very interested in the kind of security side of cloud native and a lot of the projects and interesting developments that are happening on the security side.
00:11:31 [W] yeah I prior to being on the TOC. I had the privilege of being the
00:11:36 [W] Keep Calm cloudevents become co-chair.
00:11:43 [W] I can 2018 which feels like a really long time ago. But I think this has been a really, you know in the circumstances this is about as close as you could get feeling like I'm in touch with people in real life.
00:11:52 [W] Definitely different times Matt Matt. Klein is up next.
00:12:00 [W] Sorry.
00:12:02 [W] I was having some audio problems. So I didn't actually hear anything. So what what are we doing now to our interns introduce yourself - yeah your background your hair.
00:12:15 [W] I fixed it literally five seconds before this.
00:12:16 [W] So this is this is good.
00:12:17 [W] We're doing a live.
00:12:19 [W] We're gonna live. Okay.
00:12:20 [W] Hey everyone.
00:12:21 [W] My name is Matt Klein. I'm a software engineer at lift. Where
00:12:23 [W] I've worked for the last five and a half years there.
00:12:31 [W] I provide technical leadership for our production infrastructure team where I spent about fifty percent of my time and then the other 50% of my time.
00:12:37 [W] I'm the de facto Project Lead of envoy.
00:12:46 [W] We're obviously spent a lot of time with folks here around the cncf am within the industry happy to be here.
00:12:48 [W] Well, thank you. Matt.
00:12:51 [W] Next up.
00:12:52 [W] We have Michelle.
00:12:52 [W] You may have muted yourself Michelle accidentally. So click the little three dots.
00:13:03 [W] Thanks. Can you hear me?
00:13:04 [W] Okay now, yep good to go.
00:13:07 [W] Yeah Michelle. I'm a software engineer at Microsoft finger for a few years now before this I was at engineered and dais where I worked on platforms as a service and our around
00:13:20 [W] A lot of time with folks here around the cncf and within the industry happy to be here.
00:13:21 [W] Well, thank you. Matt.
00:13:21 [W] Next up. We have Michelle.
00:13:22 [W] You may have muted yourself Michelle accidentally. So click the little three dots.

00:13:22 [W] Can you hear me?
00:13:22 [W] Okay now, yep good to go.
00:13:22 [W] Yeah Michelle. I'm a software engineer at Microsoft finger for a few years now before this I was at engineered and dais where I worked on platforms as a service and our around kubernative
00:13:24 [W] Is application package management.
00:13:27 [W] So historically been a core maintainer and several projects that help with packaging cloudbees about locations Helm draft seen ab and now I work in that servicemeshcon servicemeshcon
00:13:39 [W] A sands on an open services on open servicemeshcon jizya new service Smash in Plantation. I have been involved also in the governing board as a developer representative and yeah, just really
00:13:55 [W] Space is growing and happy to be here today.
00:14:01 [W] Awesome.
00:14:01 [W] Thanks.
00:14:02 [W] July.
00:14:04 [W] Also former Cube con program chair part of that elite club of hooks.
00:14:06 [W] Wow, it's been insane when we're just starting we could never imagine like how big this event would become right Chris. Like that's it's insane.
00:14:17 [W] It's humbling to be honest.
00:14:21 [W] I've next up we have sought.
00:14:22 [W] thank you.
00:14:23 [W] My name is Syed Ali.
00:14:24 [W] I'm a software engineer at Google and my background.
00:14:27 [W] Has been primarily kubernative storage.
00:14:33 [W] I am one of the co-authors of the container storage interface and have been involved with the kubernative storage communication.
00:14:38 [W] I think almost from the beginning my interest in the TOC and the in the cncf has kind of been born out of my participation in these communities and learning what healthy communities look like and you know wanting to
00:14:51 [W] I am one of the co-authors of the container storage interface and have been involved with the kubernative storage communication.
00:14:52 [W] I think almost from the beginning my interest in the TOC and the in the cncf has kind of been born out of my participation in these communities and learning what healthy communities look like and you know wanting to
00:14:53 [W] And help grow the cloud native ecosystem.
00:14:55 [W] Awesome. Thank you Sade. And finally we have Shen.
00:15:00 [W] Hi. Hi, I'm Shen.
00:15:06 [W] I'm one of the co-founders and CEO of Rancher Labs.
00:15:08 [W] So I'd Rancher Labs.
00:15:09 [W] We basically built a business around, you know, commercializing cncf Technologies, like kubernative eyes and Helm and Prometheus fluently lot of lot of them. We also try to contribute to
00:15:23 [W] In to CN CF like Longhorn and more recently k3s, which became sandbox projects.
00:15:31 [W] Often thank you sharing it's great to kind of have a mix of you know, as you could see there is folks that come from and user companies from vendors, you know and start up. So we have kind of a healthy mix on the TOC.
00:15:47 [W] I'm now going to go through, you know a few minutes to kind of explain just in general how the cncf is structured, you know, just, you know, try to you know, reiterate some of the principles we have in our organization and then I'm going to go ask some questions to the TOC
00:16:00 [W] Go through, you know a few minutes to kind of explain just in general how the cncf is structured, you know, just you know, try to you know, reiterate some of the principles we have in our organization and then I'm going to go ask some questions to the TOC and
00:16:02 [W] Hopefully to you know the audience so I'm going to go quickly share my screen and see if this actually actually works. So hopefully everyone sees this content,
00:16:15 [W] This content but you know, we started with a nice kind of brief introduction, you know with our Toc members, you know, if you're not really intimately familiar with how cncf Works in terms of how its structured,
00:16:29 [W] Scenes is you know, it is a Linux Foundation sub foundation and with every Linux foundation.
00:16:44 [W] So Foundation, we generally always separate are you know, fun and governance and Technical governance. So and cncf we have a governing board.
00:16:47 [W] These are essentially members who pay in the organization. It's a mix of vendors and users. They mostly fund the organization so we could put on events such as coupon and you know, do things like security Audits and so on. So these are folks that essentially have it, you know,
00:17:00 [W] you get a chance potentially have a seat on the governing board and you know, focus on marketing related initiatives like webinars and so on by being on the governing board, they have a chance to have a voice or vote into how the budget is spent in the organization, but they don't
00:17:15 [W] So on so these are folks that essentially have it, you know, you get a chance potentially have a seat on the governing board and you know focus on marketing related initiatives like webinars and so on by being on the governing board, they have a chance to have a voice or vote into how the
00:17:16 [W] He's in technical matters for say the TOC that is on you know, this this this presentation, you know today is what we call the technical oversight committee.
00:17:30 [W] They're essentially 11, you know technical experts in the cloud native field.
00:17:37 [W] They control the admittance And archiving of projects in the community. We have over 50 projects now in cncf which is a little bit wild and they're they're basically to act as a resource to guide.
00:17:45 [W] Projects and kind of oversee the overall technical strategy for the organization.
00:17:53 [W] It is important to note that the TOC essentially represents the different constituents in our community. We have eleven folks and there are seats that are reserved for the maintainer community and cncf
00:18:06 [W] Go to the end user Community to the seats to Toc themselves get to select which is little bit interesting and six of the seats are run through a governing board election, essentially so you kind of a mix of interest there and we haven't,
00:18:21 [W] And user Community, which I'm sure some of you have seen the Keynotes from Cheryl who leads that that kind of serves as a wait for end users to communicate and share practices in a setting where you know vendors are necessarily constantly trying to sell them.
00:18:37 [W] major bodies, you know, you know make up the cncf overall and you know today were mostly focused on the TOC one interesting thing that a lot of people don't realize is we have written down the
00:18:52 [W] The operates that was both blessed by the governing board in Toc.
00:19:02 [W] There's you know, a two handfuls of principles that go over, you know, you know, if you kind of go through them just kind of gives the overall philosophy of how we how we run the organization from a Toc perspective.
00:19:12 [W] You know, I'm not going to go through all of them. But essentially, you know from a quick glance, you know, the organization that's you see what you know is focused on projects, you know, we're focused on ensuring that projects are self-governing the TOC.
00:19:26 [W] Doesn't step into an interfere with project related, you know duties.
00:19:34 [W] we have a rule around no King makers and know kind of one size fits all if you know of the 50-plus cncf projects, some are very small some are maybe specifications and some are large as kubenetes and Prometheus.
00:19:43 [W] We are also not a traditional standards body which means you know, we focus on code first and real world uses and you know, really above all the organization there is
00:19:53 [W] To kind of help projects and kind of get out of the way.
00:20:05 [W] We recently also formed a special interest groups, which kind of helps scale the TOC over time initially when we started the TOC was only nine.
00:20:08 [W] It was kind of small. We were much simpler organization I think back then but as we grew, you know, we started to basically from special interest groups and kind of focus specific work in coordination in these group to help scale the TOC the kubenetes community went
00:20:21 [W] And we're very kind of inspired by the work there.
00:20:24 [W] So usually if you're new to the TOC and the technical community truly recommend you start your participation in one of these special interest groups.
00:20:39 [W] They're very welcoming and it's a great way to kind of get involved from day one, especially if you have a you know, a focus area or specialty from from a technical perspective, you know, in terms of proposing projects. This is a question that we get asked all the time
00:20:47 [W] To simplify this process a lot.
00:20:52 [W] A lot of it is now documented in one place on GitHub.
00:21:06 [W] We have different project levels, which will talk to the TOC about in a second. But if you kind of want to you know, look at proposing a project cncf, I recommend you checking out that document.
00:21:07 [W] We have a new simplified sandbox process, which if you're aware of recently, we started to accept a lot of sandbox projects at for a lot of deliberation when it came to that process, but you could always look at previous project.
00:21:18 [W] Puzzles on our GitHub one kind of important thing to note is we do open meetings and almost all of our documentation at work happens in the TOC repo on GitHub.
00:21:32 [W] So that was kind of the brief kind of you know, how we work.
00:21:36 [W] how you know how the organization you know kind of runs from a Toc perspective. Now, I kind of want to take an opportunity to ask some questions to the TOC and you know more importantly kind of get their feedback on where they see the organization going.
00:21:50 [W] The future and honestly what projects you know, they're looking to potentially bring in and what areas they want to focus on in the future.
00:22:00 [W] So I will stop sharing my screen and start, you know asking some folks questions there. So one question, I you know get quite often from folks is you know,
00:22:11 [W] As you know, you know, why does cncf allow, you know competing, you know projects, you know, why is why is that healthy and and so on so, you know, I'd love to kind of hear, you know, someone from the TOC to kind of take on you know, why is this?
00:22:26 [W] You know, why do we allow this?
00:22:27 [W] Why is this a good thing, you know for our community do this because you know, some people say it could be confusing you're giving me options. So anyone want to kind of step in and discuss. You know, why we allow this this approach.
00:22:40 [W] I'm happy to assist I mean, I think that I mean that was a really good comment from one of the containerd E maintainers just the other day saying actually cry I really inspired us to work.
00:22:59 [W] Think about how we integrate cri-o and containerd and to bring it into the project because originally containerd and cri-o container the were totally separate project and they've now been integrated and that integration is is actually continuing to become closer.
00:23:13 [W] And that was actually inspired by looking at how cry I was doing things.
00:23:22 [W] And I mean, I think that open source has always been about choice.
00:23:32 [W] I mean we joke about you know, Phi versus emacs and whatever but like these choices are part of our, you know part of the well, some people just people like working one.
00:23:34 [W] We're working another way.
00:23:36 [W] Very explicit about things can fail things can you know what happen at the same time or do you know different ways and different things can happen and projects? We've had projects merge in the cncf, which is great.
00:23:56 [W] So the opentracing and so on I think so. So I think there's a lot of different Journeys projects can take and I think there's a lot of learning and this is a really new space and there's loads of stuff that can happen.
00:24:09 [W] I think that trying to decide upfront that something's going to win is just a mistake.
00:24:12 [W] I agree with that.
00:24:19 [W] Go ahead Michelle. And then Liz I'll just jump in here.
00:24:21 [W] Yeah. Um, I agree with that.
00:24:24 [W] I think it's healthy to have different perspectives and different solutions in this space and like Justin mentioned like, you know, there's a collaboration and mergers and consolidation that may happen later, but people have different organizational
00:24:38 [W] different development environments and different deployment environments and production environments and it's just there's no one-size-fits-all like like you mentioned so it's nice to have these competing Solutions and if there's a way to consolidate in the future
00:24:54 [W] Consolidating the future great if there's not that's okay too. As long as things are I think I hear the term and and unlike the term now operability a lot.
00:25:08 [W] So, you know your solution should have a way to fit in and work with other Solutions. And as long as there's kind of a story there, I think it's nice to have different solutions in the space.
00:25:18 [W] Awesome.
00:25:24 [W] I think there's it's not just about a point in time.
00:25:29 [W] You know, this is the snapshot of the set of projects that are currently Cloud native in 2 3 4 5 years time. I don't think any of us know which of these projects are still going to be, you know, the star solution for each particular.
00:25:39 [W] And new better more efficient in whatever way improved versions solutions for different parts of the problem might come along that would be a really good and healthy thing that Innovation might come from within
00:25:55 [W] Maybe it comes from her a separate project and that's all good and healthy.
00:26:07 [W] Yeah, I think that when the one of the principles are sorry lets you know, in fact one of the principles are Chris you said earlier was no cure makers and one size does not fit all so I think the
00:26:17 [W] The F takes on one project doesn't mean that you know all the innovation in that particular space is already happened.
00:26:25 [W] Definitely, you know a healthy competition is always a fuel for Innovation and our end users is is so that so big and so were right.
00:26:42 [W] Yeah and ask accepting different projects really help to grow the space that's good to hear because you know for many users sometimes, you know, I hear the like cortex or Thanos I'm confused like, you know containerd ER
00:26:54 [W] I think it comes at a cost potentially any users, but it's good to hear from your perspective.
00:27:00 [W] Cool, so, you know that's that's great to kind of hear people's view of viewpoint on that.
00:27:16 [W] It's definitely kind of something that people asked frequently and confusing where people just assumed that we would you know bless one particular, you know solution where we don't we're more similar to an organization, you know, like the Apache Foundation which has ton like
00:27:23 [W] Sort of something at least so, you know another you know, kind of question that comes up, you know, quite frequently is around. You know, what is the TOC going to focus on you know in the future what's essentially missing in our landscape
00:27:39 [W] Projects, you know, you know, where does the TOC kind of one invest its time in there?
00:27:55 [W] So you notice anyone kind of want to discuss what their Viewpoint is in terms of what cncf is potentially missing in its, you know, Suite of 50 plus projects that we have so far.
00:27:57 [W] Liz's smiling or from two of our end users could be good.
00:28:07 [W] I think one of the really great things we have right now is you know that the end-user technology radar that input from end users that we get, you know from people
00:28:26 [W] T on the TOC and then that's where we're going to find out where the real gaps are that need to be solved and also some of the projects of missions that we're starting to see from end-user companies.
00:28:42 [W] I think a lot of this seems to be in the area of like, how do you manage the platform that your developers are going to write their code native applications on
00:28:54 [W] there's tons more on that kind of operational side that and exactly what the problems are.
00:29:03 [W] I think it's the end users who will tell us, you know best about both what the problems are and what the best Solutions are.
00:29:10 [W] Also jump in here. I think Matt Klein really opened my eyes to operational dashboards and seeing projects like clutch from left and backstage io4 from Spotify.
00:29:27 [W] just really obsessed with that whole Space now and want to understand, you know, how we can integrate our other projects those those components and the solution keptn.
00:29:39 [W] Talked about like there's five different solutions for a problem. So you should you know pick one but then have like a unified interface to really interact with all your infrastructure related tooling an operational tooling. So I am
00:29:54 [W] Fort space I think historically if I'm shy away from it because a lot of us aren't you know, front-end developers a lot of us are kind of scared about the security implications of dashboards and things like that.
00:30:10 [W] So but there is a I'm seeing our renewed focus and interest in that space and I'm just really pumped about it.
00:30:14 [W] So that's one area and then just I think we've been talking about
00:30:20 [W] software supply chain security for a really long time but we think our finally getting to a point where there are like some tools that are maturing in this space and this is kind of becoming more top of mind for people and
00:30:34 [W] Out more and more best practices and patterns put in place, but that's an area.
00:30:39 [W] I think that's ripe for Innovation and hardening and mature maturity and maturing whatever the work right word is but yeah, so those are two things that I'm really interested to cgroup.
00:30:53 [W] Awesome anyone else.
00:30:56 [W] How about sod Storage storage or go ahead go ahead Katie.
00:30:58 [W] Sorry, I think that they did you lay on my side.
00:31:07 [W] Yeah, I just want you to agree with me show quite helpful here because from an end user perspective.
00:31:17 [W] I think it's going to be extremely valuable into abstract as much as we can and as much as it actually makes sense from the point of communities and I think it comes to actually have this transparency where your application is from a developer standpoint.
00:31:22 [W] You don't really need to understand kubenetes, but you need to know how to operate with it anymore.
00:31:27 [W] Well talking about looking for structural parameters talking about actual developers and actually closing that Gap.
00:31:39 [W] I think there is a lot of movement in that area to actually make sure that there is a smooth experience of a boarding as well.
00:31:47 [W] What I've actually like to see more basically Enterprises with opt-in Cloud native applications. There are still quite a resistance. There is still these thinking of
00:31:52 [W] You need to pay your support or have a support team available 24/7. So you always have that back up plan. But I think this is where the community comes in quite nicely together to actually produce these best practices
00:32:07 [W] And failover to making this house and actually sharing some of the failure stories. All of these feedback. Loops are quite important for the end users and becoming to understand better how to operate the tool and to actually raise this maturity level.
00:32:21 [W] So I'm really kind of hoping to see more in this perspective is actually seeing a wider adoption from bigger companies and big names.
00:32:31 [W] Also, thank you.
00:32:35 [W] Thank you Katie. And one more quick question before we kind of look at there's any questions from the audience Sade storage can of comes up a lot in terms of you know questions asked to see and staff at the city of stuff unfortunately and you know storage
00:32:48 [W] So consider a boring and then I think things have gone and improved direct, you know tons in the kubernetes community, but I hear a lot about devices and other kind of, you know outside of the typical block and blob storage at kind of love your perspective. Some of them you think gaps that we can fill in this area. Yeah,
00:33:03 [W] I think you hit the nail on the head block and file storage is had a ton of innovation especially around kubernative in the last few years would see us I you know, you can integrate any existing block or file storage system that you have.
00:33:18 [W] We have a ton of software-defined storage system Solutions within the cncf portfolio with the Rook you can integrate Seth and other sdss. We have Platforms in sandbox, like openfaas that are trying to
00:33:30 [W] Innovate in that area.
00:33:39 [W] I think the interesting area moving forward is going to be at the level of non-blocking file storage.
00:33:41 [W] So thinking about object.
00:33:44 [W] How do we how do we have the same type of kind of ease of use and portability that we have now with block and file with object storage and that's a difficult challenge.
00:33:54 [W] I've seen some activity and that would the Cozy project and beyond that databases are always an
00:33:59 [W] resting challenge as well and there are set of products that are available in that area, but I'm going to I'm pretty sure we're going to see a lot of innovation and in that space as well awesome exciting
00:34:14 [W] Given, we have a you know, probably a handful or two minutes left.
00:34:19 [W] I list looks like some questions are coming in finally from the audience.
00:34:24 [W] Here's an into a question from missing from Tony.
00:34:28 [W] How do you ensure you represent? All communities using Cloud technology many science domains are lurching into the cloud but have very different business needs not super familiar with kind of with, you know, the science domain or what that refers
00:34:39 [W] You want to take a stab at that?
00:34:45 [W] I feel like we're anyone want to take a stab at that one. I can take a very quick snapper.
00:34:47 [W] When it came to us.
00:34:49 [W] refuting there were there were some different containerd runtime Singularity is the one that Springs to mind where I don't recall right now exactly what the different requirements were, but
00:35:05 [W] it was felt that in that environment I think part of that was actually to do with needing privilege, you know, they have an alternative solution to kind of Ruthless containers, but I
00:35:20 [W] Broader question. How did we represent? All communities is through events like this and conversations and getting to know people and people telling us what their problems are. That's
00:35:32 [W] we can't figure out any other way and just yeah, well, that's alright.
00:35:43 [W] I when I was co-leading kubernative Sig apps.
00:35:45 [W] It's a while back we had some bio Tech folks come in saying they wanted to use kubernative is to make research easier for for people and that just really lit up my eyes and I was like, wow, that's so cool.
00:35:59 [W] excited to be working on a spin in a space that enables that kind of Technology.
00:36:03 [W] And so I think just to add an echo.
00:36:07 [W] what Liz is saying it's events like this, you know being as open and transparent as possible in the space welcoming anyone who wants to be involved which we you know, we really worked super hard on at every level.
00:36:22 [W] all of doing another cncf staff everybody involved has kind of been echoing the same message which is you know, if you want to be involved you should be involved in here are all the things your has all the information and just jump in and you know, we'd love
00:36:37 [W] Have you be involved?
00:36:43 [W] I think it can be overwhelming but we're trying to be as transparent and welcoming as possible and make this like kind of what Level Playing Field and I think the vendor neutral bit of it helps with making this whole Space
00:36:54 [W] a Level Playing Field and lowering the barrier to entry
00:36:58 [W] and if I can add to that, I think the TOC here it's impossible for us to be able to represent every single Viewpoint and and understand all the requirements that everyone has and so one way that we're scaling is through these
00:37:14 [W] Cncf storage space shuttle interest groups and the special interest groups are effectively small communities where everyone is welcome to join and provide their input and that gets funneled into the TOC and plays heavily into how we operate.
00:37:30 [W] Yeah, absolutely.
00:37:33 [W] I definitely recommend talking to talking to the sex and talking to people.
00:37:46 [W] I mean, I think that we've had a lot of involvement with some of the bits of HPC and and sides and little bits, but I really if it come and talk to us and help direct you to the right place.
00:37:48 [W] Yes, exactly.
00:37:49 [W] Go ahead great job reaching out to different projects in the space and bringing their demos to the to the Sig meeting. So it's a two-way street always.
00:38:01 [W] Definitely.
00:38:03 [W] I've been told we have five more minutes, you know left before they kick us off which I think has time for one question.
00:38:10 [W] What's interesting about the HPC space?
00:38:14 [W] I don't know people will realize there's another event out there called super compute, which was actually happening at the same time as cube con last year and it's a look at another 10,000 person event with like all HPC people.
00:38:25 [W] people. So it would be cool if we found a way to kind of bridge those communities because you know, they are solving interesting problems. Maybe we'll fund some type of
00:38:31 [W] Of Toc at supercomputing, you know one time I don't know. Well, we'll figure it out one final question before we kind of wrap things up. And you know, we're always available on the TOC channel in the TOC meetings are open question from Alexis here.
00:38:44 [W] Do you feel about some cncf in Apache projects kind of trying to solve the same problems regarding standards thinking about cloudevents and openmetrics.
00:38:56 [W] So basically having cncf had an Apache having similar competing overlapping projects insert a key XKCD comic about standards.
00:39:03 [W] Anyone want to take this question.
00:39:05 [W] If not, I'm happy too happy to jump in and say it's to take I think it goes back to the the first question around kind of why do we have competing competing products within the cncf right?
00:39:25 [W] I think it all goes back to Innovation.
00:39:35 [W] It's you know, it's difficult to say that one project for sure is going to have the right answers for everything. And so until there is that Clarity it's worthwhile to explore and innovate and
00:39:38 [W] Allow the Innovation to happen. If a de facto, you know project emerges in a space maybe, you know, it's time to deprecate or archive project.
00:39:50 [W] We're totally open to that as well.
00:40:03 [W] All right, there are lots of projects that crossover between foundations and there are things that you know, and that are in other foundations that some people think should be in different places, but there are you know,
00:40:04 [W] There's Comfort cooperation across those groups of people to and I think that should be more and it's particularly, you know, it's kind of these aren't supposed to be silos or the and they and things are not supposed to be grouped by.
00:40:19 [W] A accidental things but it I mean it definitely makes there's any Community around kubernative things in cncf, but that's it's not exclusively that by any means and projects that are interested, you know.
00:40:34 [W] We are always welcome here. But if they're not here, we still people will still work with them and cooperate with them.
00:40:41 [W] Definitely in the interest of mean I'm go ahead week with last one and then we'll wrap things up.
00:40:49 [W] Okay, good kitty.
00:41:03 [W] What I wanted to add is actually I find these intercept well intersection of different projects more of a complimentary thing because as long as the foundation's aim to create this apis Greece for
00:41:06 [W] Duration, as long as they provide project that can be used by the end users into actually useful.
00:41:13 [W] I think that's the main point and again going back to if you have the two foundations providing or supporting projects in the same area.
00:41:23 [W] This is the more motivation to have this healthy competition, which has been mentioned by Delta X here. So I think it's actually an engine for formulation think it's all complimentary.
00:41:34 [W] complimentary. I don't think they should they should actually fight with each other right away.
00:41:38 [W] Awesome, you know given that way about 30 seconds left will kind of wrap things up regarding that a little we we've done a lot of work where you know, we have that the kubernetes community meet with openstack and other kind of organizations and projects.
00:41:52 [W] So I think the projects are always open and if you know if you see areas where we're not being collaborative or we should be clouding. Please reach out to the TOC and the cncf staff were we're happy to kind of accommodate. So with that said, you know, we're
00:42:05 [W] About overtime and you know, please take an opportunity to join Toc meetings, you know, hopefully people see that were, you know, everyone's a friendly bunch here and, you know looks forward to kind of helping our, you know, wider Cloud native
00:42:20 [W] So, thank you everyone on panelists for your time, and hopefully you enjoyed our virtual Cube Khan, which has been a bit of an adventure for all of us. So thank you again. I'll and see you next time.
00:42:31 [W] Thanks, everyone. Bye.
00:42:35 [W] nks.
