00:00:01 [W] Hello everyone.
00:00:05 [W] My name is Katie Comanche.
00:00:11 [W] And I'm one of the cloud platform Engineers for American Express.
00:00:20 [W] I joined American Express around six months ago and I am part of the team that aims to transform the current platform by embracing the cloud native principles and making the best use of the open source tools as well quite recently.
00:00:24 [W] I've been elected as one of the TOC the technical oversight Committee Member with the cncf alongside 10 of our Champions within the open source Community. I'll be responsible to stackrox.
00:00:32 [W] Here and maintain the technical vision for the cncf landscape pretty much where the community that enables and leverages projects to move for all the cncf I point today.
00:00:47 [W] However, I would like to talk about class 3 pi and more specifically to provide guide and how to get started to experiment and use this tool and to do so, I would like to introduce firstly the echo system that enabled cluster API to be to be developed as a tool.
00:00:59 [W] Then I'm going to follow this by introducing and describing the cluster Epi components and I'm going to finish with giving an example of how cluster API can be used in association with the gitops model before I move forward.
00:01:14 [W] I would like to introduce the echo system that allow classroom API to be developed. Now, if you look six years ago, the container orchestrated framework space was very heavily Diversified. We had tools such as dog has worms, but she messes chorus with kubernative
00:01:28 [W] All of them provided viable solution to run containers it scale over in the last year's kubernative took the lead in defining the principles of how to run these containerless workloads nowadays kubernative sits known for its portability and adaptability.
00:01:43 [W] But more importantly trades approach towards declarative configuration and Automation and this has been extremely beneficial for kubernative because all the time of community flourish the rounded based on the cncf surfing 2019
00:01:58 [W] More than 50% of this record companies are using kubernative in production.
00:02:06 [W] The other 42% are actually prototyping kubernative as a viable solution to move forward when we transition towards the development Community more than two thousand Engineers are actively collaborating towards feature build-out and Bug fixing
00:02:18 [W] When you looking to the end user Community within twenty three thousand attendees were registered at the keep concealed and the world that there's going to be Draconian Europe China and North America.
00:02:29 [W] And this has been extremely beneficial for kubernative because of the time multiple tools were built around it to extend its functionalities this created. But today we know as the cloud native landscape which resides under the cncf umbrella now if you look into all of
00:02:44 [W] To link some of them are going to provision similar capabilities such as servicemeshcon networking grunting and another category we can identify is the cluster provision in corporates dropping currently.
00:02:57 [W] There are more than 100 distribution structure.
00:03:00 [W] We allowed the bootstrap of the cluster and cluster API is one of those skills as well.
00:03:11 [W] If you looking to the ecosystem is mentioned their plethora of tools provisioning is capability. Some of the most widely tools are such as kubeedge e M2.
00:03:14 [W] You sprayed cops Teutonic and many more.
00:03:21 [W] However, if you look into every single tool is going to be difficult for us to find a common denominator.
00:03:30 [W] What it actually means is that every single tool is going to integrate with a very specific subset of cloud providers and this in itself imposes quite a few challenges.
00:03:34 [W] Supposedly as an end users what happens if you'd like to migrate to infrastructure to different cloud provider, even if you use the same construct tools tool is going to be very little usable components.
00:03:49 [W] Usually the end result is going to be writing your infrastructures code from scratch.
00:03:52 [W] Now we challenges imposed if you'd like to migrate to a different tool all together for example tectonic, which I introduced earlier is no longer under active development than it is to be merged with openshift containerd platform.
00:04:07 [W] That means that moving forward one solution is to for the project maintaining to house or you'll have to choose a different tool which means that you have to be writing for structures code from scratch. Again.
00:04:19 [W] The another challenge is presented by areas such as China and some time Russia because it's quite challenging to deploy your infrastructure to those areas and this is because in China, for example, there is an entire subset of to link already provision for
00:04:32 [W] Cluster was dropping.
00:04:39 [W] Usually we lose these shift and lift and shift capabilities and we have to create a snowflake infrastructure in these regions.
00:04:47 [W] However class straight bi intercepts all of his challenges and Provisions are settled declarative apis that will allow the cluster creation configuration and management and more importantly it will integrate with different Cloud providers
00:04:57 [W] When you talking about cluster API will refer to see cluster life cycle, which Heidi's first initial release in April of 2018 since then the head to release has and they currently present a v 1 Alpha 3 API endpoint now as mentioning the
00:05:12 [W] Street vendor grades of multiple Cloud providers and currently there are 14 of them from which we have the support for some of the major Cloud providers such as AWS or TCP.
00:05:26 [W] There is an initiative to integrate with bare metal providers as well such as mail for your packet, but more importantly we're going to have the support for Chinese Cloud providers such as by the cloud Alibaba cloud and Trace end and this
00:05:37 [W] The cluster API really enables and empowers the end users to create a cluster in China with the same ease that would create a cluster in Europe or in the US.
00:05:48 [W] Now, let's look a bit more details how class straight guy works supposedly would like to create a subset of people multiple clusters in different regions with some Cloud providers.
00:06:05 [W] The first thing we're going to need to provision is going to be the management cluster for testing purposes.
00:06:12 [W] It is recommended to use kind and kind is just a decreased version of kubenetes. If you'd like to use cost repair in production, if you want to see early doctors, it is recommended to use a fully fledged keeping disclosed.
00:06:19 [W] And this is because it comes with a more sophisticated failover mechanism.
00:06:25 [W] Once we have our management cluster, we require our dependencies known as the controller managers and to have a fully working version of cluster. API will require three sets of controllers.
00:06:38 [W] wonderful cluster you guys here it is 1 for the bootstrap provider and the last one for the infrastructure provider now clustering Pi introduces five new customer service definitions and will require a controller for every single one to make sure that
00:06:51 [W] Can create delete and reconcile any changes we have today's resources.
00:06:56 [W] The second component with the second controller is going to be the bootstrap provider and this is going to be the component which will translate the llamo configuration into cloudiness script and it will make sure to attach an instance from any cloud provider to the cluster as
00:07:12 [W] This capabilities provision by to be DM and tell us and the last set of controllers will require a going to be the infrastructure providers.
00:07:24 [W] And this is the particle which actually interacts with the apis directly and Provisions the infrastructure such as instances subnets.
00:07:31 [W] I enrolled sleepy see subnets and many more it is worth to mention that if you'd like to create a cluster in multiple Cloud providers will require a controller for every single cloud provider as well.
00:07:43 [W] And once we have our dependencies will be able to provision our Target clusters. And these are going to be the Clusters we will deliver to our Engineers to put the application on and so going to be the Clusters the consumers or our users
00:07:57 [W] I'm going to connect to interactive application now as mentioned previously plus 3 Pi introduces five new resources cluster control plane machine machine set and machine to blend.
00:08:12 [W] The cluster resource is going to be taken care of firstly of the networking components for our classroom will be able to specify settings such as the spider for our services and pods as well any DNS suffix if you had
00:08:26 [W] the control plane is a new resource, which has been introduced in the last release.
00:08:36 [W] So the third release and it provides a declarative way to manage or control play or the set of Masters.
00:08:37 [W] Machine configuration is going to be very similar to node will be able to specify the version of kubernative.
00:08:44 [W] We'd like to run however will be able to attach information such as the instance type the region you'd like to run these Machining if you'd like to attach an SSH keys or cell phone.
00:08:54 [W] Mission set is going to be very similar to replica said it will make sure that we have an amount of Machinery Services up and running at all time and machine deployment is very similar to deployment. It actually comes with a very powerful rolling out strategy making sure
00:09:10 [W] That we can reconcile any changes to our machines.
00:09:15 [W] You just have to mention that the Machinery Service is mutable.
00:09:24 [W] Now, if you have new configuration, the distances of the resources with the old configuration are going to be taken down and the new instance with new configuration is going to be brought up.
00:09:29 [W] There is no patching. There's only me to bility.
00:09:31 [W] Josh really showcase the Simplicity to configure your cluster within cluster Epi.
00:09:41 [W] I would like to make a comparison between the current way and introducing the tools such as skips spray that gives prey is a tool that will allow the provisioning of a cluster by using ansible as infrastructure as code in this view. We have a trend output of
00:09:54 [W] some of the roles and engineer would need to be aware when creating debugging troubleshooting deleting the cluster cluster API completely were things this process and it reduces the cluster creation to a couple of manifests
00:10:09 [W] I'd like to create a clustering AWS. This is going to be the Manifest you going to be requiring.
00:10:14 [W] Here, we have a cluster resource and Beyond Alpha free and point and in the spec section.
00:10:24 [W] We just choose a slash 16 subnet for our pods as well.
00:10:31 [W] We've as mentioned with the new version of going to have a control thing reference. You can see that towards the end of the Manifest.
00:10:32 [W] However, I would like to draw your attention to is the infrastructure reference because this is the configuration to interact with our cloud provider and this particular case. We have an AWS cluster created in V1. Alpha free employment.
00:10:47 [W] I was actually going to happen underneath it will invoke the parameters which are specific for this cloud provider as such we say that we would like to create our cluster in reaching you Central one and we'd like to attach an SSH key name with the name default
00:11:00 [W] two other instances
00:11:01 [W] Now if you'd like to create this class during juicy this are going to be the only change is required as you can see. The only thing that changed in our infrastructure reference is the kind of our cluster is going to be Giuseppe classroom now,
00:11:17 [W] This will invoke the values which are very specific to gcp passage. The region aiming is quite different.
00:11:25 [W] We're going to have Europe West for you.
00:11:29 [W] We have the concept of a project which is quite specific to disappear as well.
00:11:32 [W] And we associate our cluster of C API as well be able to attach a network and in this case, which is provision is name, but more importantly we can see from this example that we can reuse our manifests with very little changes in
00:11:44 [W] and them
00:11:45 [W] So far, we just created our cluster resources to have a fully working Target cluster will require two actual have all control plane, which is already associated with our cluster.
00:12:01 [W] So with the control plane going to have all our masters already managed and of course will require our data plane and this can be represented by a machine deployment you chose to just going to take care of a collection of machines. We will Define
00:12:12 [W] and the last concept I would like to introduce is how can we use cluster API with a gitops model now the most powerful concept class 3B actually introduces is that we can think about our clusters as researchers. We can fully
00:12:29 [W] Slide that in llamo configuration. If you have llamo configuration, that means that we'll be able to have it stored engage. So we're going to have a Version Control around versions and the history of these resources and more
00:12:44 [W] urgency will be able to introduce a layer of templating and usually this is provision by configuration manager such as hell and customize and once we have these two components such as gauge and configuration managers by
00:12:59 [W] Folks will be able to make use of a tool get up Stone will be printed provision by Argo City or Reef actually flux provision by weaveworks.
00:13:10 [W] Now the gitops model uses the git repositories to describe the desired state of an application and this is exactly where we actually reach or the climate to reach with cluster API because we can fully automate the classroom provisioning with just one
00:13:26 [W] And this is precisely what I would like to demonstrate today.
00:13:32 [W] So, let me just share my screen very quickly.
00:13:34 [W] Cool. So at the moment, I already have a cluster proficient with cluster API and it currently has five nodes free Masters and free workers.
00:13:49 [W] And in this demo today, I would like to Showcase.
00:13:50 [W] How can we scale?
00:13:54 [W] For example, the amount of our work notes by using the gitops model.
00:13:56 [W] Let me explain what the actual have this view currently in the bottom part. You actually have all the machines which in resources for all cluster as you can see three of them sir for them are okay.
00:14:07 [W] Hopefully and two of them are all data plane or Mission deployments now when I'm connected to my cluster and currently I am connecting by using with your config file, which is just toured as a secret.
00:14:22 [W] I'll be able to see that again. I have a cluster. We've free Masters and two notes in version one 17.3 but more importantly was worth to mention it that this particular cluster was
00:14:36 [W] Is provisioned by using Argo CD So currently I have an Argo City model and if I just take the up details I'll be able to see that. I'm provisioning a positive your elbow.
00:14:51 [W] I have all my manifest stored and of course I can parameterize that by using a values file and you guys just look into that particular repository.
00:15:02 [W] So this is the cost repair gitops for the tree in the template. I'll be able to help all my customer service definitions.
00:15:06 [W] So I'm going to have my cluster resource, which we actually went through in the previously in the slides.
00:15:14 [W] So again, I'm just choosing a site or for my pods.
00:15:17 [W] I'm having a reference to an AWS clusters and so forth but more importantly as you might notice.
00:15:25 [W] This is already a Helm chart and I have already templating enabled on it as such I think if I go to implement loodse, I think there's going to be a better example.
00:15:32 [W] What actually would have for example we can see that I can template the version of kubernative I have and this is a very specific way for Helm to actually consume these values or for example, I can template them on of replicas or the mound of
00:15:47 [W] Knowns I'm going to have in my classroom.
00:15:49 [W] And just to showcase the values file currently.
00:15:55 [W] It's very straightforward is just kind of an example to Showcase this mechanism, but I'm tabulating here is mentioned is the conversion the amount of Masters all control plane and the amount of workers now
00:16:09 [W] if you look into
00:16:11 [W] Our Argo City of you will be able to see that. For example, we have already two machines which are this one actually three of them this one this one this one which I'm going to be the control plane for Masters, but more importantly we're going to have a machine deployment which
00:16:28 [W] Finds our day to play with a machine set Associated and two machines very similar to a deployment within kubernative and currently if I go to my values file, I would like to change
00:16:43 [W] The fabric is for example to 5.
00:16:47 [W] five. I'm just going to clean that we've very
00:16:51 [W] simple commit message.
00:16:57 [W] So to have it as a demo, and I'm just going to pretend changes.
00:17:00 [W] So now when I'm actually going back to my Argo City of you I'm going to trigger a lookup so it's actually going to look into the repository to will see that we have a new value for our work and O's
00:17:17 [W] and one substrate about you synchronize
00:17:20 [W] hopefully soon. We'll be able to see that the amount of replicas with the machine school grades.
00:17:26 [W] I think I need to send it because I set it to manual as well.
00:17:31 [W] Cool.
00:17:38 [W] Yes, as you can see we have new machines actually being provisioned we go back to our cluster.
00:17:44 [W] We see that three new machines are actually to be provisioned and the most important thing you feel can to AWS as well console will be able to see that we have three new machine actually being initialized.
00:17:56 [W] And this is a very powerful concept because we really can't automate the entire process of creating a cluster and we really can treat our clusters as cattle rather than pets we can recreate it with minimal. He's it actually is just at the
00:18:11 [W] And of Click, so one play we have a cluster up and running.
00:18:16 [W] And this pretty much concludes my demo, which is going to return to the slides.
00:18:21 [W] Now before I finish I would like to leave you with a few takeaways about cluster a pi plus 3 Pi has been so efficient and so successful in such a short amount of time because it uses the building blocks principles.
00:18:38 [W] It is not concern itself to integrate and with kubernative and Provisions has capabilities that way to actually build on top of the available Primitives and makes the best use of customer service definitions.
00:18:47 [W] another important feature about cluster EPA is the fight ovhcloud mostly it truly provides this one interface which will allow us to integrate with different Cloud providers, but more importantly to use and reuse our manifest all the way through
00:19:03 [W] and last thing I'd like to mention about cluster cluster API is currently under extreme active development. If you have a use case for class straight guy, please give it a try and feed it back to the community now is the perfect time to customize cluster API to
00:19:19 [W] since
00:19:20 [W] You should like to know where to find more technical details of our cluster Epi.
00:19:30 [W] I did collaborator fun of the maintainers for class 3 pi/2 provision to provide actually a cncf webinar.
00:19:40 [W] So if you'd like to understand class AAA from a mentoring point of view, please visit or watch the webinar over there as well. I have written an article with more details of how can you actually
00:19:47 [W] Start playing with claustrophobia an experiment to prove that there's going to be available on medium. And if you have any questions in regards to today's program, I'm always going to be available on social media such as Twitter or LinkedIn to enjoy the rest of the conference.
00:20:01 [W] you.
00:20:02 [W] Hello, everyone.
00:20:15 [W] I think I'm lonelier cool.
00:20:20 [W] There are plenty of questions actually coming in later on especially on the last minute. So I will try to tackle as much as I can through this life KN a of Y. So I'm going to be available in the keep common operations channel in the cloud knative
00:20:33 [W] It's like workspace.
00:20:45 [W] So a couple of questions which actually stood out where the question about when you're a straight guy is going to be beta or GA now, there are some currently
00:20:50 [W] Cluster epa's if you want Alpha 3 and in the new release the actual trying to move to a more stable version is actually stable.
00:20:58 [W] It's just in production, but the actual game that stateless. I think it's something which is going to happen in the next next release or the next public releases. So it's definitely on the radar.
00:21:08 [W] Another question, which actually was an underlying Fred here.
00:21:15 [W] So the question is related to things for example, we'll really how Cloud providers and night in knative way for them to provision communities questions such as do kak segs.
00:21:31 [W] What is the benefit of cluster API instead of standard infrastructure as code framework. Now, this is pretty much a more kind of complex answer cluster API tackles a few challenges if you don't want to be
00:21:43 [W] Locked into a specific vendor, then you might consider cluster EPA as a solution for you because if you're going to use for example jchiarie k3s, if you'd like to for example for cost reasons would like to transition to a different public Cloud.
00:21:58 [W] There's going to be a bit more difficult to have to recreate or clusters from scratch infrastructure as code as well.
00:22:12 [W] And as well, you will not be able to migrate your for example GTE terraform to and eks, so it's going to be quite quite a different.
00:22:13 [W] Approaches to do that with cluster API.
00:22:19 [W] we actually can have this consistent amount of manifests that will be able to use for out and this is pretty much one of the its kind of highlight of why it's such an important tool because if you have one interface to plug
00:22:31 [W] Different Cloud providers and you can reuse it manifests as well save the structure is code.
00:22:41 [W] It's something you can it's just a fundamental and it can build on top of it.
00:22:42 [W] some of the other questions
00:22:46 [W] Oh, one of the questions I think to answer is how cluster Pi works with their metal on Prem clusters So currently if you thinkin about provisioning your cluster on a complete Burr metal machine, that's not something
00:23:03 [W] The supported however, the supported for providers such as packet or others Tinker as well.
00:23:18 [W] So you actually have to kind of use a provider. But if you just take a VM and if you want to use cluster you going to be okay. It's going to be a bit more difficult because there is no API to actually integrate an automated provisioning of those machines.
00:23:24 [W] Cool another question, which was actually quite interesting is since we have a special really to the demo since we actually have our declarative approach for the amount of replicas we have in cluster.
00:23:42 [W] So with the gitops model would be able to set amount of workers and amount of Masters.
00:23:48 [W] How does that interact with cluster autoscaler? And which rejects is going to determine the the machine number?
00:23:54 [W] This is something which is still work on because currently weigh the cost rate by context.
00:24:02 [W] We do not have that automated cluster or the scalar.
00:24:07 [W] So for example, if you want to use that with AWS, you have to integrate available specifically and actually provide all the credentials for you to identify how many numbers of how many replicas of your machines require
00:24:17 [W] Currently, this is I know this is like a feature they were working on but currently the moment it's something which is done manually mainly to actually set your amount of machines. So again, it's still working.
00:24:32 [W] They have this kind of feedback.
00:24:39 [W] It's quite available to provide it to the maintainer so they can actually create any fishing backlog of the future.
00:24:41 [W] Is that the community requires?
00:24:42 [W] On our question, which actually I think hopped on quite a lot in the past as well. Are you able to import an existing cluster into cluster EPA coach?
00:24:54 [W] Probably know because there is so many nuances of how you created that initial cluster be degraded mentality created with specific cloud provider the versioning all of these is difficult to pretty terminal cluster API.
00:25:10 [W] The easiest way is to actually create it from scratch.
00:25:24 [W] We've got straight guy. So there is not because they're like so many others is because we don't talking about how can migrate existing database clusters talking about any kind of clusters and that implies a
00:25:25 [W] it off kind of tweaking a lot of detailed configuration for the cluster to be up and running and from that reason is quite difficult to determine one standard way to transition those clusters and managed and of cluster EPA because
00:25:40 [W] Street guys images provisioning in the future it actually aiming to for example to upgrade to clusters and that's why they introduced the control plane resource, which is quite new it actually appeared with the last resource and with that we'll be able to actually upgrade.
00:25:55 [W] Welcome child playing celebrating your Masters one by one the same.
00:26:01 [W] How reliable is to use a stray Pi in production So currently there are clustered guys may or may not inviting we're talking to people that maintainers. They already have teams which are using those
00:26:34 [W] ' I do provision production clusters.
00:26:38 [W] so their use cases, but definitely I encourage people if you actually have a use case tried and do feedback because we really require that insightful information of how different teams
00:26:51 [W] Context are using cluster. Epi.
00:26:54 [W] Right, there are plenty of questions.
00:26:58 [W] They're like so many questions. I'm trying to go for them choosing some of the best ones transfer at the moment.
00:27:04 [W] How does management class to relate to the Target clusters?
00:27:11 [W] So this is like of quite in New Concept introduced by cluster API because you have this Inception model you require a small cluster just like this since you can cluster to create clusters in different Cloud providers, whatever you want.
00:27:24 [W] So the target clusters are going to be the Clusters are going to be proficient to developers.
00:27:31 [W] They are the cluster who's going to hold your applications.
00:27:33 [W] These are like the final thing to fit the result with the management cluster. That's
00:27:35 [W] You can at least in my example. I use just kind cluster which is very easy to probation.
00:27:44 [W] You just have kind great cluster.
00:27:50 [W] You have it already know local machine. You just need that because it works with Zod suit was portworx with kubernative manifests you require a context and kubernative structure deploy. All these resources there is why management cluster is actually important
00:28:00 [W] So this is the incipient cluster and from there you'll be able to create more and more.
00:28:05 [W] Yeah, let's have a look.
00:28:10 [W] What about the support for a Rancher and up and shaped?
00:28:22 [W] Is that something on the road map in terms of the integrated Cloud providers?
00:28:26 [W] Definitely there is a common mistake. There is already a integration with with red hat.
00:28:33 [W] not really sure if is going to be open shape because openshift is a very similar offerings such as JK is a manage clusters managed service by Red Hat. However, I'm not sure about rancher there might be some.
00:28:44 [W] Initiatives there, but definitely there is as long as there is an API in point to create your infrastructure will be able to integrate across 3 Pi so I don't see any areas there some of the listeners here.
00:28:58 [W] Usually that particular collaboration why not?
00:29:04 [W] it's all about the community, right?
00:29:04 [W] cool
00:29:08 [W] There are plenty of questions about their bare metal again mentioning here.
00:29:22 [W] It's if you actually using a provider returns that better metal, then you'll be able to do so on a simple machine. Unfortunately, that's not the case yet.
00:29:28 [W] I think there was a question in regards to if using cluster API does it mean you cannot use skips spray any more tools, like if spring that's definitely not the case.
00:29:48 [W] I think these tools and this is why it's all about these open cooperation officers because they have multiple solutions for for the same problem.
00:29:58 [W] So with cluster API, you'll be able again if you would like to provision multiple clusters in different infrastructure providers having
00:30:03 [W] Manifest there's going to be the case if you'd like to skip spray for example to health as simple as you construct your scolding. You can integrate with AWS we can do this on bare metal that the gain is is Reich.
00:30:14 [W] It's more about like the different problems that actually solve one is just a simple with keeps break as well.
00:30:28 [W] We've only a couple of Club dividers while straight days more expensive.
00:30:29 [W] So again, it really depends what you're trying to solve.
00:30:29 [W] It really depends.
00:30:33 [W] What actually is the end result you want to get out of these tools and how do you want to describe and manage your infrastructure as code?
00:30:42 [W] And I've actually got a notification that I've got 30 seconds left.
00:30:45 [W] So I think this is going to be my last question to be answered.
00:30:47 [W] But again, I'm going to be available on social media have more questions.
00:30:49 [W] Please.
00:30:49 [W] Let me know. Please do to
00:30:53 [W] read the article medium quality webinar, and I'm going to be available as like as mentioned before school. Thank you very much for all your questions.
