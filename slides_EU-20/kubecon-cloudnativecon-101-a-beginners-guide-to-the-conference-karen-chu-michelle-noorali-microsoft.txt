00:00:04 [W] Every wine thanks for coming to our presentation.
00:00:08 [W] This is a beginner's guide to the conference.
00:00:10 [W] I'm Michelle Neroli and speaking with me.
00:00:12 [W] Today is Karen shoe.
00:00:14 [W] I'll let Karen introduce yourself. First.
00:00:15 [W] Go ahead Karen.
00:00:23 [W] Hey, so I'm Karen choa. I'm an open source Community manager at Microsoft on the Upstream container compute team and I joined Microsoft via dais three years now and at this point I've been to about 7 cubic
00:00:32 [W] Vons
00:00:32 [W] And I'm Sean Riley.
00:00:36 [W] I'm an engineer at Microsoft.
00:00:39 [W] I also came in Via an acquisition with Karen.
00:00:40 [W] So we go way back. I've attended a total of nine Coop cons. And that's actually kind of kind of why we wanted to talk to you all today.
00:00:54 [W] We've seen the community and the conference grow so much and it's amazing event with lots to offer and sometimes it can be easy to kind of miss some things if you're new.
00:01:04 [W] Or be really overwhelmed if you're new, but we want to make sure that this conference is very welcoming and as welcoming today as it was for us when we first started going so we just want to talk to you about some lessons
00:01:17 [W] tricks and things that you might want to keep an eye out for
00:01:21 [W] All right. So in today's 101 course we're going to go over the following topics.
00:01:30 [W] We're going to talk about how to follow the code of conduct tips around and cutting sessions.
00:01:33 [W] what cncf projects are how to engage with project maintainers approaching the sponsor Hall what to expect in the hallway track social events to check out and things to think about if you want to consider submitting talks in the future.
00:01:48 [W] So first things first the code of contact this is a funny foundational component of all Linux foundation events. You can find the one for Coop con. If you go to the event website and hit the drop-down attend and then click code
00:02:05 [W] Contact essentially says, you know be professional make sure your appropriate workplace Behavior.
00:02:15 [W] Follow your employer's guidelines following applicable laws and just generally be you know, professional and any and all harassment of any form is unacceptable.
00:02:27 [W] Of course, these guidelines apply in both virtual virtual and physical settings on social.
00:02:35 [W] social media and on any relief digital platform
00:02:38 [W] If you are a witness or a victim to any violation, please contact any event staff and Report what you've seen or witnessed and you should rest assured that every staff member has
00:02:56 [W] Taken incident response training so they understand how to deal with incidents and in the future. If you have any concerns regarding the events before the event takes place just be sure to contact the people that are listed on
00:03:11 [W] Website this includes the conference staff and they have emails and phone numbers listed on the on the website for you.
00:03:22 [W] And so, you know, they take these things. Seriously. They want to make sure that the event is safe for everyone and a good comfortable space to be in for us to all learn and get to know each other.
00:03:33 [W] So be sure to take advantage of these things.
00:03:34 [W] All right, Karen talk to us about attending sessions.
00:03:42 [W] Okay, get in the clips.
00:03:42 [W] Oh, yeah.
00:03:49 [W] Yeah. So okay. We know our first glance the schedule looks super overwhelming but don't worry a good way to start is to look at the schedule by the tracks and figure out what general topics might interest you. So on the left side of
00:03:58 [W] The slide you can see a screenshot of what the filters look like.
00:04:02 [W] This can be found on.
00:04:04 [W] Sorry.
00:04:07 [W] It is on the right side of this like of the Flies.
00:04:09 [W] Yeah, so that's what you want to look for.
00:04:13 [W] Don't forget to check out the 101 truck, which I have starred.
00:04:15 [W] That's where this session Falls all this content has been created for newcomers. So, you know, it's a good place to get yourself oriented. And then also look out for the beginner level sessions that you can also filter for on.
00:04:28 [W] Under content experience level which is also starred.
00:04:35 [W] Yeah, and then another quick tip is to utilize the sketch tool.
00:04:42 [W] It's a great way to build out your schedule and figure out like where you might have some overlapping sessions and just like figure out what your day is going to look like and then as for attending sessions themselves, the main takeaway we have for you is to take advantage of the QA
00:04:50 [W] Speakers will be available for QA during the duration of their session.
00:04:56 [W] And so feel free to come up and share questions you have as they come up and just remember to follow the code of conduct.
00:05:08 [W] If you are interested in slides check out the session page on sched speakers will be sharing their slides there so you can reference it after and if you miss a session or want to re-watch something all the sessions will be recorded and posted to
00:05:16 [W] Tube usually with a few days if not sooner.
00:05:19 [W] It's always awesome to see everything go after super quick online and in case you missed anything, so just some advice from us from personally attending sessions.
00:05:36 [W] I want to be really really adamant about like don't be afraid of asking what an acronym stands for we have a lot of them in the cloud need of community and they might even overlap with
00:05:46 [W] Other acronyms that you have at your internal internally at your company that you work at or in the industry or Niche that you're involved in.
00:05:59 [W] So just be sure to like ask if you're if you're not sure what it is.
00:06:02 [W] Karen you want to take this next one?
00:06:15 [W] Yeah, so when you're asking questions, you know help people understand the angle you're coming from you can share things like, you know, what you're trying to solve what kind of position you're in. We're trying to solve for and just keep in mind that when you're asking questions. You might be asking
00:06:21 [W] Shows that others haven't yet thought of them that could apply to those.
00:06:25 [W] Yeah, definitely and if you normally take notes up physical conferences, like I do try seeing if it's helpful in this virtual setting to a lot of the times when we're at home or, you know, not in the office or not the actual
00:06:40 [W] Event we get all the lazy or like we're going to watch this like it's TV, but just that doesn't always like help you like take everything that you can away from it.
00:06:55 [W] So if you do take notes charging in this virtual setting and see if it helps you. Yeah, and then also like, you know, we know it's a virtual conference and it's super easy to get distracted.
00:07:06 [W] So we just recommend closing, you know, other browser windows and other applications if you do have any workloads,
00:07:10 [W] If that you have to tend to consider scheduling some dedicated pockets of time to address that throughout the day.
00:07:18 [W] So looks cncf projects.
00:07:24 [W] Yes.
00:07:26 [W] I'll talk a little bit more about this girl at the conference.
00:07:28 [W] You might hear the term cncf project a ton and let's take some time to discuss what that means.
00:07:36 [W] But before that let's talk about what cncf even is real quick.
00:07:40 [W] So cncf stands for cloud needed Computing foundation and the foundation's mission is to make cloudevents.
00:07:49 [W] So as an open source project develops in the ecosystem, they may get donated to cncf as vendor-neutral IP and within cncf there are three different levels of projects.
00:08:04 [W] Um as they mature Incan adoption, they level up they go from sandbox to incubating to graduated and if you're interested in learning more about the cncf projects or cncf and it's projects. We recommend checking out the links that we have on
00:08:17 [W] Sighs okay things to check out don't be overwhelmed the case studies on the cncf website are amazing.
00:08:32 [W] The landscape gives you an idea of the breadth of projects that are in this space.
00:08:38 [W] The technology radar will give you an idea of how angular this are thinking about specific verticals of Technology like ci/cd or security and then what things are adopting and using
00:08:47 [W] using and and even recommends so something new that's something new that we're trying out to Holly check that out and just to kind of hard van deventer neutral IP a bit about the cncf.
00:09:01 [W] This is something that helps folks get over the legal hurdles of donating. I mean, I'm a contributing donating or contributing code or documentation to a project that isn't owned by and mainly
00:09:13 [W] run by their own company
00:09:16 [W] So you may also hear like the term Toc and cncf cigs a lot also good acronyms, but just to kind of expand that expand on that Toc stands for technical oversight committee.
00:09:34 [W] And say stands for special interest groups. So the technical oversight committee is a group of 11 people and they are responsible for the technical vision of the cncf.
00:09:49 [W] Yeah, they also vote on the projects that come into the cncf all the levels cncf Sig's are focused on particular areas like a delivery or observability or not working.
00:10:04 [W] Security so they have their online particles and these are groups of domain experts that build their own guidance and documentation around what is going on in terms of in the cncf and the broader ecosystem.
00:10:20 [W] System in their vertical but also the advise the technical oversight committee on the projects that are submitted to the cncf.
00:10:31 [W] So there are very key to this whole organization Liz rice, who is the TOC chair will be doing a more in-depth session on the TOC and thus eggs and I recommend attending her session
00:10:43 [W] Learn a lot more about this stuff and more information about the cigs and the TOC can be found on the cncf TOC GitHub repository.
00:10:58 [W] So if you want to join in or figure out when they meet all of that web all of that information is listed and linked on the GitHub repo.
00:11:05 [W] And throughout the day you'll also direct the next few days.
00:11:12 [W] You're also see a Sig session. So there are kubernative six that are kubermatic project-specific and then there is cncf 6 which are cncf broader and broader or groups that focus on those
00:11:24 [W] Because I were talking that I was talking about. So just check those out.
00:11:32 [W] There's introduction sessions. If you just want to get a glimpse of what people are working on and there's longer the Deep dive sessions. I think those are more for deeper discussions for the Sig group members to meet and hash things out face-to-face
00:11:43 [W] really so good things to look out for
00:11:47 [W] Alright, let's talk about project maintainers.
00:11:52 [W] So you also hear the term project maintainers quite a bit. And and this is if you're not familiar with open source, or this kind of ecosystem and environment.
00:12:09 [W] Let me just explain for a second. Like what a project maintainer is.
00:12:15 [W] So project maintainers are responsible for the code base and documentation of a particular project they review and contribute code and documentation they so
00:12:24 [W] It will like, you know fix bugs review and contribute features.
00:12:36 [W] They'll also help with the building and releasing the project any maintenance ongoing maintenance work just like up keep reviewing and fixing security related concerns.
00:12:46 [W] So they're the keepers of the code base essentially and and there are the people you want to go talk to if you have any questions or if you want to like propose some
00:12:54 [W] nothing.
00:12:56 [W] Yes. So earlier on the subject of attending sessions.
00:13:01 [W] Different tracks you or a Vine. I want to focus on specifically the maintainer track. So again, it's start cncf projects are on the maintainer track.
00:13:15 [W] There are intro in Deep dive sessions. Like there are for the Sig sessions and you can filter by the maintainer truck sessions to find them and also see on the lookout for the project could be Liam. So here you can find project maintainers of various cncf incubating and
00:13:25 [W] Tweeted projects so there will be Project Specific boots essentially and depending on the team.
00:13:38 [W] There will be maintainers on standby to help answer questions and some of the projects will also be doing office hours.
00:13:39 [W] So be on the lookout for that and yeah anything else with Charlotte and questions that people should ask.
00:13:46 [W] Yeah.
00:13:52 [W] Well on the project Pavilion bed, I think like I always enjoy that so I hope folks take advantage of it. I'm a maintainer and I
00:13:56 [W] really enjoy standing at the booth and talking to people who are thinking about using our project or using our project and you know, just want to have a quick session.
00:14:10 [W] Just even me, you know, like I love hearing what people are working on and and love understanding how they're using the project and what gaps they see but then it also has a someone who uses a bunch of
00:14:19 [W] These projects I love having the opportunity to go and meet the maintainers and just say hi, you know like it's so nice to put a face to a GitHub handle.
00:14:32 [W] So, yeah, so when you do meet people share a little bit about yourself, so how their project can help you ask how to get started
00:14:45 [W] Ask how you can get involved because a lot of times there's Community meetings or slack channels or other ways of being involved long term in case you have questions or want to just contribute or something like that.
00:14:58 [W] All right. So let's we're going to talk about approaching the sponsor Hall.
00:15:02 [W] We know our first glance. This is also going to look daunting. But the main thing to take away is that the sponsor Hall is the perfect opportunity to chat with companies and people in the ecosystem.
00:15:18 [W] So if you're looking for anything specific in terms of like services or Solutions, this would be the perfect time to have those conversations.
00:15:25 [W] And since this is a virtual event.
00:15:27 [W] We know the interaction is obviously going to be different than normal. So the way we're doing it this time around is the sponsors will have a live chat.
00:15:33 [W] Teacher at their Booth where you can hold one-on-one conversations with someone and when it comes to asking questions, you know, we're still pushing the same thing in terms of like things. You should bring up right more.
00:15:48 [W] I think you can talk about our side from like what you're working on and what you do like share a few of those specific problem that you're trying to solve or if you just want to hear what's out there right?
00:16:00 [W] Like if you're just here to learn another thing is to ask others what problems they're working on wide. Something is a problem in the first place even
00:16:06 [W] and how they're trying to solve it.
00:16:07 [W] Yeah, and don't forget to check out the smaller boobs, you know, the big boots are great, but people are innovating in all levels.
00:16:17 [W] So this is your chance to get in early on what people are working on and they're really cool new projects.
00:16:27 [W] And also there's a booth crawl, so don't forget to check that out.
00:16:29 [W] Unfortunately.
00:16:31 [W] We aren't going to be having any cute Beverages and snacks, which I always enjoy but this is a
00:16:36 [W] He did window of time to check out the sponsor Hall without any competing activities like sessions or peanuts.
00:16:45 [W] Yeah, and then lastly so swag real quick.
00:16:52 [W] It's just like our industry term to say giveaways. Essentially.
00:16:59 [W] They're really just meant to help you remember interactions that you've had. So obviously that's gonna be different around this time around but be on the lookout for virtual swag. So for example, I designed some chronosphere.
00:17:06 [W] Password puzzles and word searches for the Microsoft so, you know check that out. I'm just really curious to see like what creative forms of Swag people have come up with this time around.
00:17:16 [W] Same here.
00:17:21 [W] All right, let's talk about the hallway track.
00:17:24 [W] So this is also an industry term.
00:17:36 [W] If you go to a lot of conference, you've probably heard of conferences you probably heard of this, but if you're not familiar hallway track is how we refer to basically foregoing the sessions watching the recordings and just hanging out in this concert hall
00:17:39 [W] And not working and meeting up with people from the community.
00:17:48 [W] So we'll basically chat Kappa chup work on things sometimes even on code, which is cool.
00:17:55 [W] If you are, you know not working with people here are some things you can share make sure you tell people that this is your first time attending coupon and read its really excited when you like say that talk about what
00:18:06 [W] looking for how much exposure you had to cncf Technologies of you've contributed to anything if you just read some Doc's if you tried something out and that's always very helpful and also share your professional background what you're working on your
00:18:21 [W] Where is and projects you've contributed to the past in the past?
00:18:32 [W] I think there is a slot channel for this event carrying on and talk about that.
00:18:40 [W] Yeah, so the main I think main form of communication at least text size is going to be on slack. So make sure to sign up for slack.
00:18:43 [W] You should be able to find a link in the email that you get for the events and it will be organized by track specific channels and also be on the lookout for extra.
00:18:53 [W] Owls for networking and if you're not already familiar with spok definitely check it out our communities cncf, you know kubernative uni, heavily relies on stock for real-time Communications.
00:19:04 [W] All right, the fun stuff social events.
00:19:16 [W] Yeah, so very during a normal physical that social events are obviously a great way to meet people nonetheless.
00:19:22 [W] three stole pretty important and valuable to participate in virtually, you know, when you're on a virtual conference, right or when you're at a virtual conference, it can be super draining just to be able to clear all day like super focused. So just kind of take these virt.
00:19:33 [W] Virtual social events as a as a reminder to take a break, right and yeah social events to me also communicate the kind of culture that a community is really trying to Foster.
00:19:48 [W] Yeah, I would highly recommend checking out the vents that we have organized.
00:19:52 [W] Yeah, and there are quite a few of them listed here.
00:19:58 [W] I'm excited about this game games Lounge sponsored by Red Hat is a virtual job board sponsored by AWS musical performance by Michael Hicks and drag queen bingo.
00:20:10 [W] So cops about that.
00:20:15 [W] Yeah, huge shout-out to the events team for organizing all this for us.
00:20:16 [W] Yes, they're always great in person and I'm very excited about the virtual ones too.
00:20:21 [W] Yeah, so
00:20:22 [W] Let's take a moment to look for is now if you're interested in speaking out of future conference.
00:20:36 [W] You'll want to consider submitting a cfp. And what is the CFE so it stands for call for papers and anyone can submit. This is the process that is used to select talks for you know to conferences and
00:20:43 [W] These talks are reviewed by a program committee made up of community members and you know TL there they work to build out the conference schedule.
00:20:52 [W] So some general outlines to think about General guidelines to think about when it comes to see FPS are that sessions are meant to cover open source Technologies and should be vendor-neutral. So as a speaker, you know, we're here to push Innovation and not
00:21:06 [W] It's really to solve anything and there are a lot of different formats. You can consider so you can consider doing a regular presentation a panel lightning talks and you know, take your pick awesome and
00:21:22 [W] So Karen, I have both done key notes as well as session like regular sessions. I coupon cloudbees of Khan and other open source conferences, and I was actually a coupe
00:21:38 [W] Conference chair in 2017.
00:21:50 [W] So both of us have experienced writing and reviewing conference proposals and just read thousands of them.
00:21:56 [W] So I wanted to like maybe pull out a few bits to think about before submitting.
00:22:02 [W] So when you're thinking about submitting or when you're crafting your cfp, make sure you clearly articulate the problem area in one to two cents.
00:22:08 [W] Isis so like what problem are you solving set the scene one to two sentences super brief and also talk about what the audience will take away.
00:22:21 [W] So your conference your cfp will have a section on it called abstract and these are the things that you want to include in the abstract and this is also the thing that will be posted on
00:22:33 [W] and on the conference schedule just as something that the audience members will see in order to figure out there appear conference session is something that they would enjoy and take away learn from
00:22:48 [W] So it's kind of your pitch.
00:22:55 [W] So you also want to include your expertise and experience in the area.
00:22:58 [W] Did you build this taller and technology did you use it and like really hurt and like learn a lot of along the way these kinds of stories really resonate with the community and also talk about how
00:23:10 [W] Your project or your conference or your project or your conference session or your use case or whatever you're talking about fits into the ecosystem and how your session will help
00:23:25 [W] The ecosystem grow and learn and also make sure you ask people to review.
00:23:34 [W] I always send my cfps to folks that I work with just to kind of glanced at give me feedback and I'm always happy to other read other people's see of bees to before they submit takes a few minutes and it's nice to just get another
00:23:46 [W] Of ions things I don't you think it's easy.
00:23:50 [W] Yeah, and as part of that review process this ball is like, you know, you can go and check out previous abstracts it as examples.
00:24:03 [W] So like what I will do sometimes go to, you know, like an older Hugh Condon like schedule page and just like look through the sessions there because obviously those are the ones that got selected right? So like they serve as good examples of what
00:24:13 [W] I should be sharing in my own cfus.
00:24:17 [W] Yeah for sure great advice.
00:24:20 [W] Okay, and some parting thoughts be sure to stay involved after the event.
00:24:28 [W] These conferences are just meant to be a Kickstart for you to get involved with the community meet people learn stuff, but you can stay involved with local meetups in your area online.
00:24:39 [W] You can also go to kubernative Community Days. Those are like minikube.
00:24:42 [W] Coupon climbing akan conferences by geared at local communities.
00:24:53 [W] There's also a newsletter you can follow and submit to called kublr clean newsletter cncf webinars are held very frequently if you times a month and you can actually check those out for some great information on
00:25:02 [W] Cncf projects and the cloud native Foundation Twitter handle also has great real-time information about projects events and just the community at Large.
00:25:16 [W] Yeah sterile circling back real quick to like doing talks right?
00:25:30 [W] I think local meetups are actually a great place to get started. If you are nervous about doing talks front of a huge audience, you know, that's a good place to like test out toxins kind of see what the interest is there and get feedback.
00:25:34 [W] So it's highly recommend the eyes.
00:25:43 [W] Yeah, and if you have any questions throughout the conference or even after feel free to reach out us on Twitter, you can find me on Twitter at Terry age, too.
00:25:47 [W] And I'm Michelle nearly.
00:25:48 [W] And we could totally take you a so Arabic totally do Q&A. So you have any questions feel free to type them in and we'd be happy to answer.
00:25:57 [W] Yeah.
00:25:58 [W] Thank you.
00:25:59 [W] Thanks.
00:26:01 [W] every Vine
00:26:08 [W] Hope everyone's having a good morning. They're cute gun.
00:26:15 [W] Karen can you hear me?
00:26:20 [W] Okay.
00:26:23 [W] Yeah, I can.
00:26:23 [W] Yes.
00:26:23 [W] Out so just real quick answer to a question that was asked earlier.
00:26:35 [W] A lot of the sessions for the cement will be recorded with some of them being live but the Q&A sessions afterwards themselves should be live.
00:26:41 [W] So yeah.
00:26:42 [W] and the videos will be available on this platform on demand so you can access them right this like right after this for the next year and then after that you can find it on YouTube under
00:26:58 [W] Or a playlist.
00:27:02 [W] It's generally a playlist under the cncf YouTube account.
00:27:04 [W] Another question that came up is how do I access the hallway track?
00:27:14 [W] I don't see it anywhere on the main event.
00:27:18 [W] So there's not really anything calls the hallway track it just like an industry term that we use but people say it and then other people get confused by it.
00:27:28 [W] So we wanted to like make sure everybody was on the same page about this term.
00:27:32 [W] It's really just an idea, but it just means that you're going to meet people.
00:27:36 [W] And network with people in the hallway and talk to sponsors and my in the sponsor Lounge, so to do that there's a few ways to like communicate with people to get like kind of an equivalent ish experience.
00:27:51 [W] So you can get on the slack channels for you can get on the slack for this event. You can also check out the networking Lounge experience, which I'm going to paste a link to
00:28:06 [W] QA and there's more information about that on the event website and you can go to the concert sound between access through this platform and then chat with people at different booths.
00:28:22 [W] Yeah, so just an update on some of the information we shared in our talk you all should be sorry for the cncf or for the slack channels
00:28:40 [W] You mentioned about joining for hallway track.
00:28:46 [W] They are actually under the cncf stock itself as opposed to like a separate or so.
00:28:49 [W] Yeah, join the cncf org on slack. And if you go to browse Channel, you'll be able to see like the full list of all the different channels that you can join to have conversations.
00:29:03 [W] Yeah, and you know, if you're following the specific track for the conference, I'd recommend going to that specific.
00:29:10 [W] Annal and just you know kind of hanging out there to see what people are talking about.
00:29:15 [W] Yeah.
00:29:16 [W] Hopefully that's helpful.
00:29:17 [W] See, hey Karen, this question looks really interesting.
00:29:23 [W] What do you feel provides or provided the most value to you at your coupon physical or virtual?
00:29:30 [W] What do you think Hmm?
00:29:33 [W] Um, yeah, I mean I think for me I mentioned this earlier just utilizing schedule time normally during a you know, a normal conference. It's like I'm running around everywhere and it's super easy to just kind
00:29:49 [W] Forget where you need to be.
00:29:56 [W] So even even with the virtual format and just for future reference right?
00:29:58 [W] Like I recommend using sketch develop your schedule just again to kind of like remind yourself where you need to because you're likely to just get pulled into conversations as they come up.
00:30:11 [W] But yeah having a good place to like keep track of what you want to be at is super helpful.
00:30:15 [W] What about you? Yeah.
00:30:17 [W] For me, I think it's like when I when I stood at the maintainer booth as a maintainer, I learned so much about how people were using a projects we were working on and it's not like these
00:30:31 [W] People are not like always like experts at like a certain tool or whatever.
00:30:41 [W] They're just trying to like get something done at their company. So just really fine. Second real-time like talk through problems.
00:30:47 [W] So I just personally really enjoyed that and I just love them maintainer.
00:30:48 [W] I think just called Camilia nor whatever the term for it was called last year.
00:30:59 [W] That was really cool for me also really like the sessions like I know we can watch all of them like later, but I don't
00:31:03 [W] usually always opt for a hundred percent hallway track experience.
00:31:09 [W] I always try to like go to as many sessions as I can because there is nothing like really consuming that information live and being able to ask questions live and you know see other people's questions live, so I don't know if that's
00:31:21 [W] Like that definitely like helps me but it's not for everyone.
00:31:26 [W] The real quick someone did ask me what the project is billion is so I'll just talk about it a little bit more.
00:31:39 [W] So if you go to the event website, you'll see under expo hall.
00:31:46 [W] There is an option to visit the project Pavilion. And so this is just another space normally the sponsor or the expo hall is with sponsors, right?
00:31:56 [W] So this experience is just going to be similar but with cncf projects so
00:31:58 [W] That's where you'll find it and it's just kind of the booth experience, but with a cncf project or multiple projects there there.
00:32:08 [W] I see this other question and I've seen like two questions like this.
00:32:16 [W] Someone was asking is there an acronyms dictionary or is there a more like is there somewhere we can see the terms Toc and Sig like kind of spelled out some more so
00:32:29 [W] I don't think that there is an acronyms dictionary.
00:32:34 [W] Although I think that's a great idea and I'm going to ask to see if somebody wants to like help with that because it's a great idea.
00:32:42 [W] But for now you can go to the cncf website, which is just cncf dot IO or the cncf TOC GitHub repository, which is github.com cncf.
00:32:56 [W] ax / Toc for more information about those terms that we talked about and specifically if you go to the cncf dot IO website iof site go to the people Tab and under the people tab,
00:33:11 [W] See more information about all the groups associated with the foundation.
00:33:16 [W] Michelle maybe you can help answer this question. So someone asked well so they said the cncf landscape can be overwhelming.
00:33:36 [W] What's the what are some like good questions to ask to figure out which projects can help with which problems?
00:33:40 [W] Oh, what are some good questions to ask as okay.
00:33:45 [W] Got you. Okay. So there's also a cncf trail map which is a little bit simpler to look at it.
00:33:50 [W] It tells you the common questions or problems people will run into and they groups of projects that can help you tackle those problems.
00:34:05 [W] So if you're overwhelmed by the landscape, check out the trail map first and see if there's anything that kind of.
00:34:08 [W] Sticks out there and helps you figure out like what problem seeing you can tackle with these projects, but I would say like there are definitely categories on the
00:34:24 [W] Landscape, so if you go to the landscape website, you can filter by these like areas so like security or app deployment or not working so you can filter by these
00:34:39 [W] Areas, and like see a little bit more I would say like if you're asking someone the question like or you're trying to explain somewhat to someone like what you're looking for.
00:34:54 [W] Just explain your use case. Like I am this person I work with this kind of team in this kind of industry and maybe it like if you are asking about ci/cd, you know, you'd ask like oh when
00:35:06 [W] Feeling pressure something.
00:35:08 [W] So there is the 101 so I don't know anything.
00:35:35 [W] I'm just getting involved and I want to like learn more about what problems I can solve.
00:35:39 [W] That's like one one question. You would ask at like day one or like Day Zero and then we talk about day one operation. So very frequently people will say, okay.
00:35:49 [W] I'm just like getting started.
00:35:52 [W] I'm just getting to a point where I'm like on kubernative use or using containers or using certain Cloud native Technologies. And so I just want to get up and
00:35:56 [W] Burning, that's day one.
00:35:58 [W] All right, then day two operations is I've got my stack my cloud need to stock in order and I want to think more in depth about security and automated workflows and I want
00:36:13 [W] This thing are run like a well-oiled machine and I want to make sure that you know, I'm doing I'm you know doing all the best practices and Breck best practices could go and do a 1/2 but so that's day to operation.
00:36:28 [W] Oh.
00:36:31 [W] Add some stuff going.
00:36:43 [W] Hey Michelle, are you still there?
00:36:59 [W] I think you're You Dropped a little bit sound wise.
00:37:02 [W] All right.
00:37:10 [W] I'll see if I can answer any questions in the meantime while we figure that out.
00:37:15 [W] One of the questions was someone asks if it makes sense to follow a specific track or kind of make their way around the conference and like attend as many different sections as possible.
00:37:27 [W] ack
00:37:28 [W] Can you say something?
00:37:31 [W] Okay, I can't hear you.
00:37:37 [W] I can see you. Okay, I would say that if you're like honestly if this is like your very first conference, like I had mentioned earlier I do check out the 101 track.
00:37:51 [W] I think it's a good place to get started just because it can get really overwhelming if you just jump into things obviously like if you are a little more familiar with things, you know, I would go to the specific text that you're
00:38:02 [W] Interested in so again kind of think about think about this all in in terms of the different tracks that there are available, you know, obviously with you have a specific role that has a pertinent track. I would go there
00:38:17 [W] I wouldn't necessarily just jump in and see like, you know jump into whatever session is available. Like when I log on yeah try and make it like as personal to you as possible and just also keep in mind like all these sessions are recorded
00:38:32 [W] It's so you can always go back to them think about it in terms of like what sessions you might want to ask live questions, right?
00:38:42 [W] So kind of prioritize that and then like I said, you can go back and see the other sessions afterward Michelle you there?
00:38:54 [W] Hey Karen, I think I'm back now.
00:38:55 [W] Yay, okay.
00:38:57 [W] Yeah, cool.
00:38:59 [W] I don't know if you heard my question.
00:38:59 [W] Yes.
00:39:07 [W] Do you have any recommendations around like whether or not someone should follow specific track or if they should like try and just attend as many sessions possible if it's their first coupon.
00:39:12 [W] I think that definitely go across tracks you want to get a little bit of lots of different things and they overlap so I would say like read the abstract see if you know the problem that people are trying
00:39:29 [W] Talk about like excites you and then and then, you know attend those sessions following a single track is fine if you're a specializing in something, but I really haven't seen it. A lot of people do that.
00:39:44 [W] cool
00:39:48 [W] I feel like that was opposite of what I said, but I think more so it's more of just like making sure that you pick sessions that are really specific or like really relevant to you. Right like even if there are cross tracks or on the same track.
00:40:02 [W] Right.
00:40:05 [W] Yeah, absolutely that that a hundred percent agree with and that's first I just haven't I haven't seen people do like one track, but maybe you get like really nerdy about like, you know Envoy and like you want to just go to the envoy sessions and that's totally valid
00:40:19 [W] two
00:40:20 [W] What is OSS?
00:40:29 [W] stands for open source software
00:40:35 [W] Tyler a lot of questions coming through so we are trying to filter questions that might apply the most of you
00:40:49 [W] Let's see.
00:40:54 [W] Mine's ask her some questions around the big topic.
00:41:11 [W] I think there's some lag so somebody is asking about a specific topic topic and you can actually go to the sketch website and search for your topic to see what discussions are planned around
00:41:29 [W] The specific topic and in this case, they're asking about flux City.
00:41:37 [W] So just type in flexing in the search bar in the sketch and then you should be good to go.
00:41:38 [W] There is a question around what's the difference between a tutorial versus the 101 session? So we'll see my understanding is tutorials tend to be more Hands-On and yeah versus 101 sessions are
00:41:59 [W] More I guess like just introductory material.
00:42:05 [W] There are some one-on-one sessions that are tutorials, I believe but yeah, just think of tutorials as more Hands-On and like yeah, I guess that is my answer for that question.
00:42:18 [W] Do you want to add anything to that?
00:42:19 [W] And you got it one-on-one Scoville tutorial hands on.
00:42:29 [W] Cool.
00:42:33 [W] Oh my gosh. There's like 13 pages of questions. Goodness. Cole overrated events recordings will also be available.
00:42:40 [W] Yes.
00:42:41 [W] There's a question asking about if sessions are parallel.
00:42:50 [W] Yes.
00:42:55 [W] So basically there are several different tracks running at the same time.
00:42:58 [W] So there yes, they are parallel and this is kind of what I mentioned using sketch just because like there might be several sessions that are running at the same time and you will have to pick which one you want to attend to in the
00:43:10 [W] Man, but again, all the sessions are recorded so you can always go back and watch the ones you missed.
00:43:17 [W] And it seems like a lot of you aren't sure where to see The Sessions in like chronological order.
00:43:32 [W] So I recommend you go to the Q Khan event website itself, and I'm under the program tab.
00:43:41 [W] It's the fourth tab at the top. You can go ahead and click schedule. And so this will provide you a view of all the sessions in like by time.
00:43:50 [W] As opposed to by track.
00:43:54 [W] Yeah, so hopefully you all can find that again.
00:43:59 [W] It's on the coupon website under program and then schedule.
00:44:00 [W] so
00:44:09 [W] just a lot of y'all are showing so much excitement for being here and like I just wanted to say like welcome.
00:44:22 [W] I'm really glad y'all are excited.
00:44:22 [W] I'm excited.
00:44:26 [W] I know Karen is too. So yeah.
00:44:27 [W] Great to see the energy.
00:44:29 [W] Especially on a virtual, you know event.
00:44:35 [W] I don't like you. I'm in it lack to fully.
00:44:42 [W] Sorry.
00:44:46 [W] Someone said do I do I need black to fully enjoy the whole coupon experience coupon is huge. You will never be able to do all of the activities.
00:45:01 [W] So if you feel like not working with people in real time and getting that human connection via slack is important to you definitely download it and use it, but there are so many
00:45:14 [W] Things to do so I wouldn't say that, you know, if you don't have slack or you don't use it that you're not going to be able to fully enjoy the experience.
00:45:24 [W] One person said what are some of the projects in cncf which help in Cloud interoperability?
00:45:51 [W] It's a really specific topic and it's a really good question.
00:45:59 [W] I would say there is not one specific track that's going to help you with that.
00:46:03 [W] I would say use the use cases or they are scuse me the case studies topics and check out which one of the case studies have this idea of cloud interoperability.
00:46:12 [W] Woody and also check out some more information if any of the abstracts a day to operations, that's maybe where you'll get some ideas around that there are a few projects, but it just it would make more sense
00:46:27 [W] For you to look in the schedule for those kind of that kind of information and check out the booths talked about this at the booths in this world.
00:46:42 [W] We are a bit over time.
00:46:45 [W] Michelle and I will still be available to help answer some questions. If you want to catch us at the cncf slack we will be in the channel 2 - coupon - 101 so you can find
00:46:57 [W] Us there cool well, thanks everyone for joining us for the 101 talk.
00:47:04 [W] I hope this was helpful and any other parting thoughts Michelle.
00:47:09 [W] Thanks so much everyone.
