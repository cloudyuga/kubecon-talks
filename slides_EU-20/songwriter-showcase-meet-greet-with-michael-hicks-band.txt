00:07:28 [W] It's called feels good.
00:07:31 [W] It's one of the first songs that I wrote from the guitar, like one guitar started becoming kind of a primary writing instrument and it's funny how songs live and breathe and move and evolve over time when I first wrote it.
00:07:43 [W] only knew like two or three chords and I only know a few more since then what
00:07:51 [W] Actually, it went let me see feels good to wake up in the morning and lift my hands breast taken while I'm yawning. But at least I woke up again and it's like
00:08:05 [W] That was kind of vibe and this is a song about.
00:08:08 [W] Just taking joy in being alive in the things that come with life.
00:08:16 [W] So yeah.
00:08:19 [W] Yeah, let's check out feels good.
00:08:20 [W] Yes, sir.
00:08:59 [W] Right here feels good to wake up in the morning and lift my hands Kristen thinking. Well, I'm yawning.
00:09:20 [W] what I woke up perfectly straight, but they get the Thunder rumbling a little thicker.
00:09:30 [W] Snappy but at least I got something to say go for polluting.
00:09:39 [W] feels good.
00:09:59 [W] So we came up with y'all tonight.
00:10:29 [W] To spare on the cell phone.

00:11:29 [W] Gilda singing
00:11:59 [W] Hey.
00:13:08 [W] So this song is a song that I wrote for my brother's wedding and I consider myself.
00:13:20 [W] I'm usually a lyrics first writer.
00:13:28 [W] So I had the thought of falling in love with somebody and and them leaving you speechless and so that was kind of the I knew that was going to be the concept of the song.
00:13:35 [W] And the first thing that came was actually like the end of the course the tag is this finally
00:13:40 [W] I figured it out.
00:13:43 [W] I'll simplify if I may I love you too thin. I love you now.
00:13:51 [W] I love you forever and all the way and so it was actually about it's a resolve to the speechless thing.
00:14:03 [W] Like being speechless but then finally figuring out what to say and that what to say being really simple like I Loved You Then I love you now.
00:14:14 [W] I love you forever.
00:14:15 [W] And yeah, this is speechless.
00:14:17 [W] But you're feeling late vamos bellick when phrase the like a mere clichéd a verbal
00:14:36 [W] Descriptions pale my vocabulary fails.
00:14:41 [W] There's not really much that I can say, I'm sorry, brother.
00:15:05 [W] And I tried to tell them but they could not comprehend thing that I feel inside confuses. My ends up Let My Words. Just don't quite connect This Feeling
00:16:00 [W] Sorry.
00:16:30 [W] man
00:18:29 [W] So I was on a cruise back in I guess 2015 or 2016 my wife and I she was my girlfriend at the time.
00:18:48 [W] We were on a cruise where I was playing for an artist working and we had a lot of time off so I took some gear and I wanted to write and at the time I was really heavy into sliced on Parliament Funkadelic and
00:18:58 [W] That there was this kind of vibe.
00:19:01 [W] that just came is I'm sitting somewhere in the ocean.
00:19:19 [W] That was just got adjust font and
00:19:20 [W] this was one of the few songs that was music first and it just felt good to me want to make it a big kind of gang vocal group chat thing like a really affirming type message of being proud of
00:19:36 [W] You are so yeah.
00:19:38 [W] this is it. We Are Who We Are
00:19:40 [W] It's such a blessing to be who I am.
00:20:32 [W] I had to go my mother.
00:20:34 [W] I talked to thank you ma'am.
00:20:37 [W] See her people made it.
00:20:39 [W] Well, I would have no choice.
00:20:42 [W] I was going to have this wide nose and a decent say
00:20:44 [W] singing voice and even though my childhood sometimes things to keep afloat.
00:20:52 [W] I had to throw my father.
00:20:54 [W] I told him.
00:20:54 [W] thank you, sir.
00:20:57 [W] My brown eyes and perfect site and this black hair of mine curls up really tight.
00:21:07 [W] tight. That's who I am.
00:21:25 [W] My grandma and then every Sunday morning, she thought the Golden Rule and as long as I remember my granddad it wasn't ever thin. He was
00:21:53 [W] Pranava the tells me that boy food.
00:21:56 [W] He's your friend and with my cousin and the land of fun with never stop. We share a love of basketball.
00:22:05 [W] He can't swim through snyk. Now that Legacy can thing, you know, I'm grown lives in my favorite brother a baby boy of his own. Hey,
00:22:23 [W] Take pride in.
00:23:00 [W] We are we are who we are we are who we are we are we are we are we are we are.
00:23:54 [W] Who we are We Are Who We Are Who We Are can we play a little bit?
00:24:23 [W] yeah, thank you so much for having us we're gonna play this one last song and I'll talk a little bit about in a second, but I just wanted to say I appreciate you all listening love love love one another and yeah, hopefully in the near future we can get together
00:26:10 [W] The empowerus in once again big shout out to everybody who made this possible who made this work.
00:26:16 [W] Thanks for my team for coming through and all the engineers are the video mobs.
00:26:23 [W] Just everybody who made this happen.
00:26:24 [W] Really really appreciate it.
00:26:25 [W] had a great time. So this last song is called be and as a songwriter in this town one of the ways to kind of continue to hone your skill in your craft and also make connections and hope to get place.
00:26:42 [W] Cements or whatever else is to co-write.
00:26:44 [W] I don't co-write nearly as much as I should and co-writing is basically what it sounds like it's when two more people get together and write a song. So I wrote this with a friend of mine named Ron Gilmore who at the time
00:26:56 [W] Time was living in New York and he hit me and sent me a thing.
00:27:03 [W] Like hey, man, I got a Vibe for a song and a theme, you know, could you write it this this came to me? Probably from first line straight down the page rather quickly because it just it was everything that I felt
00:27:15 [W] and I didn't take much to say when needed to be said and it's just a song about being yourself in a time where we're so inundated with you know, this trend this fad is this is all going to just encourage you to be yourself
00:27:30 [W] I think for this one, I'm probably going to stay right here and just do it by myself.
00:27:37 [W] I'ma get friends out the way I'm gonna shift this mic and move this over here.
00:27:42 [W] So I'm gonna do that. And yeah and we'll play it and this is called be
00:27:47 [W] Everybody wants to be somebody but not everybody wants to feed themselves.
00:28:02 [W] We'd rather be eat someone else and everybody wants to be somebody we all wish that we had more of what Society tells us to strive for
00:28:14 [W] Change the outside to look better listening to what other folks tell us.
00:28:23 [W] Why can't we see that? We should just be as kids sweet drop to be grown. But then when grown with long for you again,
00:28:37 [W] Why can't we see then we should just be you and me be the
00:28:51 [W] We can bring just be you and me be the best we can be everybody wants to
00:29:06 [W] Somebody we try to keep up with us down.
00:29:16 [W] Although it's never really quite worthwhile. And everybody wants to be somebody we had a way not to be seen when I mirrors don't reflect the TV screen
00:29:28 [W] We change the own son to look bad and listening to what come to Stillness.
00:29:37 [W] Why can't we see then?
00:29:46 [W] I suggest we just as the Winds of Change will blow trendy fast.
00:29:49 [W] will come and go but constantly so we so just breathe.
00:29:58 [W] You and me be the best us, but we can you and me be the banisters
00:30:16 [W] and that we can be a just be just be
00:30:39 [W] Just breathe Just Breathe.
00:31:09 [W] Everybody wants to be somebody but not everybody wants a faith in himself.

00:34:00 [W] So there's a question about social media presence where you can find me on social media.

00:35:06 [W] Yeah, and there's music there for you to enjoy one else.
00:35:12 [W] to see.
00:35:13 [W] Please any recommendations on a simple but strong Home music set up one can have main goals music composition and singing. Okay, so luckily
00:35:29 [W] To create music nowadays. It doesn't require all of this stuff.
00:35:42 [W] So good tools.
00:35:44 [W] whatever instruments, you know, you like guitar, I'd I'm a keyboards and guitar guy first my brother's a drummer and also plays the bass. So we kind of grew up
00:35:57 [W] Playing with each other in that sense.
00:36:02 [W] So a decent keyboard oftentimes now.
00:36:05 [W] Keyboards come with good sounds at a very affordable price.
00:36:15 [W] I do a lot of composing using my phone voice memos just being able to record on the Fly ideas and everything else probably as much as anything.
00:36:31 [W] So there are also programs that you can use on your computer on your phone for creating beats and rhythms and even recording its this has become a really really powerful
00:36:45 [W] To so things such as I machine drives and all those things are good places to start then later on down the line to get into microphones and interfaces.
00:37:00 [W] but the best place to start is with whatever you have around you and I have a good friend of mine who always teaches at the best microphone to use is the one that's close by so there have been things that I've actually recorded and
00:37:18 [W] Put on records that were recorded straight off of my phone. So
00:37:25 [W] yeah, I hope that answers that question.
00:37:31 [W] I have a question here about two or life and how to stay grounded while living that life to life is amazing.
00:37:43 [W] I love being on tour.
00:37:44 [W] I miss it and I hope that it can continue and resume sooner than later.
00:37:53 [W] I have done a number of different types of touring. So I toured for about six years with a renowned loser.
00:38:01 [W] to make MO
00:38:03 [W] and the weight of those tours typically work as we would go out onto a for a few weeks at a time generally anywhere from two to six weeks at a time normally during the
00:38:19 [W] work we do a European run that would if we fly over and be in Europe tour for about a month month and a half and then we would also do
00:38:33 [W] How they two-week Australian and New Zealand run, that'd be two weeks.
00:38:43 [W] And so that's how that went.
00:38:50 [W] But I've also been on tour the last three years with country music Superstars Rascal Flatts, and the way they tore the way those things work in the system that we
00:38:58 [W] For it to a natural. It's a weekend warrior system is that we go out.
00:39:04 [W] We'll leave Wednesday night go down play Thursday, Friday Saturday.
00:39:12 [W] Come back home Sunday, and that generally goes from about May mid May or early June through September October.
00:39:24 [W] So it's generally during the Summers and that's almost every weekend.
00:39:26 [W] In the same ground, it's be easier.
00:39:31 [W] to stay grounded in that
00:39:35 [W] set up because it's more consistent.
00:39:39 [W] You know, what's coming?
00:39:41 [W] You it's easier to plan for it get to be home.
00:39:46 [W] every week and it's just it's less sporadic than any we've got two coming up next month that we're just going to be on the west coast for two whole weeks and
00:40:02 [W] You probably should pack so close and they closed everything else for two weeks or six weeks.
00:40:11 [W] It's easier to just get in a routine.
00:40:12 [W] I leave Wednesday get home Sunday Wednesday night get home Sunday, and it's easier to schedule time with my wife time to go hang out with family and friends
00:40:28 [W] Knowing that okay.
00:40:35 [W] I have Sunday morning until Wednesday afternoon to get anything done.
00:40:37 [W] So I also schedule Studio sessions and working appointments or whatever else needs to happen.
00:40:46 [W] So it's much it's much easier to stay grounded and then also on to the understanding of its work like it's what I love to do and I'm grateful for.
00:40:58 [W] It it's incredible.
00:41:00 [W] I have a great time.
00:41:01 [W] I absolutely love it.
00:41:06 [W] But it's also the way that I went home.
00:41:07 [W] My portion of our income so I can take it seriously as a job.
00:41:17 [W] I have to make sure that I'm rested can't afford to get sick because the the shows are very dependent upon me.
00:41:24 [W] So I've been trying to take care of myself not getting a trouble.
00:41:28 [W] I don't drink or do drugs.
00:41:30 [W] So it's it's a little easier to do is go play the shows.
00:41:38 [W] have a good time. People eat good food.
00:41:41 [W] Come home and do it all over again.
00:41:46 [W] What else appreciate the question see what else we got here.
00:41:52 [W] How many songs do you write in a year a week a day?
00:41:58 [W] Lately zero, it's weird my writing pattern writing style.
00:42:06 [W] That is weird.
00:42:08 [W] Generally for me.
00:42:10 [W] into a rhythm pocket where
00:42:13 [W] I historically has been.
00:42:16 [W] I'll start writing one night and that will probably be somewhere between the hours of 11:00 p.m.
00:42:26 [W] 3 a.m.
00:42:27 [W] And that starts the cycle of getting into a flow of I tend to write in bunches.
00:42:35 [W] So there was a period of time last year.
00:42:38 [W] Maybe maybe september/october sometime where I was writing.
00:42:44 [W] a song or two every night for about a week straight and that was just
00:42:52 [W] Late when the rest of the world kind of shut down, my phone stopped buzzing.
00:42:59 [W] It's nothing on it. No other distractions happening.
00:43:04 [W] I will sit down Focus right and stay up as late as the energy is Flowing go to sleep sleep as late as I want to get up and do the whole thing over again, and then that's been a pattern for me since
00:43:19 [W] Since I was a kid since I was in high school writing poetry so so now the it all depends I don't write nearly as much as I used to like when I was in college right after I graduated college.
00:43:34 [W] I was writing a lot being
00:43:37 [W] and writing is a little different now tufin.
00:43:43 [W] It's not just writing compositions in songs, but it's also creating content.
00:43:53 [W] It's beat-making. It's also do music for educational curriculum. So some of the writing comes through that form as well.
00:43:59 [W] um
00:44:00 [W] Let's see. What else I'm saying.
00:44:05 [W] Okay, which roads model and my you think okay.
00:44:12 [W] So the the roads on the actual cording and sound Emporium was a mark to suitcase 73 or it may have been an 88.
00:44:25 [W] I actually don't even remember the roads that I have here. There is a finger roll.
00:44:31 [W] It's 73 stage and it is I think in 1971.
00:44:39 [W] I think I have to lift the hood and see again.
00:44:42 [W] That's a great question.
00:44:42 [W] Keyboards clearly. I have a fender Rhodes there Hohner clavinet their my Wurlitzer and North like there. I have a Yamaha CP 88
00:44:59 [W] right here and Accord chronosphere the city in front of me that you can't see.
00:45:06 [W] Thank you for that question.
00:45:11 [W] And thanks for the Love on the roads. The roads is one of my favorite sounds when writing songs.
00:45:18 [W] What is normally first melody or the lyrics I am a lyrics first writer.
00:45:19 [W] I love writing.
00:45:21 [W] will my process. I have to have a specific pain.
00:45:26 [W] College ruled paper
00:45:30 [W] and I sit down I lay down on the floor and write lyrics There are in that's that's probably 90% of the time the other percent of the time it probably comes together it so far,
00:45:46 [W] So I always keep voice memos. If a Melody hits me.
00:45:53 [W] Sing it and come back to it later or not.
00:45:59 [W] Come back to I probably have a hundred ideas that recording and not come back to what else and you're writing process.
00:46:09 [W] Okay.
00:46:11 [W] That was that was seem to be a popular question.
00:46:16 [W] What artist inspiring Spire my music Stevie Wonder is a primary influence of mine a lot of gospel music. I love gospel.
00:46:23 [W] music R&B music D'Angelo is
00:46:28 [W] A major influence of mine some of the other typical I mean, I think the Beatles of influence everybody. So there are a couple things that I've been influenced by from the Beatles everything gospel from older gospel
00:46:44 [W] James Cleveland and Mahalia Jackson through cortex and the road today's Gospel music with Kirk Franklin and everything in between.
00:46:59 [W] Also a lot of 70s Soul music.
00:47:00 [W] I love Earth Wind Fire.
00:47:04 [W] Thus the horns and Australians and everything.
00:47:06 [W] I love Al Green a low Roberta Flack nowadays, I am
00:47:11 [W] Listening to let's see. I love Lauren.
00:47:18 [W] hula and they re it's weird. A lot of my friends are big influences.
00:47:30 [W] So my parents influence me a lot, but friend of mine.
00:47:32 [W] I've influenced me as well.
00:47:34 [W] But year everything starts with Stevie Wonder and hip hop hip hop.
00:47:44 [W] I'm a I love the writing of hip-hop artists. And and so I've learned a lot from listening to The Poetry that that they write.
00:47:52 [W] Let's see.
00:47:55 [W] What else?
00:47:56 [W] It seems we styles of music do I play I consider myself a as far as a player.
00:48:09 [W] Holy fault in R&B some gospel. Like I play gospel alive, but I'm not really like a great gospel player and I say that because I know a lot of great gospel players, but
00:48:21 [W] Of R&B soul as far as what I play that pays me money to keep the lights on play country music typically a lot here in Nashville Blues.
00:48:37 [W] And will cause I'm not really a jazz player.
00:48:44 [W] as far as Fusion those I've played some fusion stuff and I tend to look at
00:48:51 [W] my music as a fusion of all of my influences of so there are a lot of things that I love a lot of different types of music like if I answer me
00:49:04 [W] some of my absolute favorite songs is Louis Armstrong's What a Wonderful World Dolly Parton still laying Christopher Cross Sailing, you know a number of
00:49:19 [W] Stevie songs, you know, and so it's all over the board. So all of those things kind of combine to make my music workers.
00:49:28 [W] Let's see.
00:49:31 [W] How long thanks for your questions.
00:49:35 [W] great.
00:49:36 [W] I think we got time for a few more.
00:49:39 [W] When aunt or how long does it take to prepare to the start of the tour?
00:49:49 [W] Okay, so typically touring works.
00:49:53 [W] But we'll start practicing for about a week.
00:50:01 [W] maybe two weeks. It depends on the tour depends on the artist.
00:50:09 [W] So in playing high production towards like with Rascal Flatts, we do a week of band rehearsals where we put the show together to try to figure out exactly,
00:50:19 [W] You know what music we're going to play how we're going to play those music. Are we doing any changes will?
00:50:27 [W] Figure out the set transitions all of those things then we do a week of production rehearsal that involve the lighting and making sure those cubes match with what's happening musically stage
00:50:42 [W] Clotting and blocking. There are things that are moving on stage a play where the risers and moving back and forth across the stage.
00:50:57 [W] Those are production rehearsals to make sure that all of those things are happening seamlessly and that they're flowing together so generally between a week or two.
00:51:07 [W] Let's see.
00:51:11 [W] of Wanda.
00:51:12 [W] What musician dead or alive but I like to meet the most that's interesting because I met so many people that I've wanted to meet I've met and talked to Stevie Wonder I met talk to Bill Withers
00:51:28 [W] Mavis Staples, I'll change to me that a chance to meet privately guy.
00:51:36 [W] It's just been so many.
00:51:41 [W] I think probably there's an artist thing 90 inch about that. I think I'd love to meet and have a conversation.
00:51:46 [W] see what I can learn and glean from
00:51:50 [W] or we to Franklin I
00:51:54 [W] I think she's incredible James Brown.
00:52:00 [W] Probably James Brown James Brown Ray Charles.
00:52:03 [W] I think that's when we'll go with Daniel Brown Ray Charles. Wanted to writing team. So personal, how do you keep your privacy is still make something personal?
00:52:17 [W] don't sometimes sometimes my songs are very very very
00:52:19 [W] Transparent that doesn't always serve the well, but I come from a culture that says to bring everything to the music and that's that's how the black church operates all of our
00:52:35 [W] Oceans and everything very demonstrative. So
00:52:40 [W] that's just where I come from and I tend to put it all the music sometimes to a fault.
00:52:50 [W] Sometimes you more than I do any conversation.
00:52:54 [W] I tell people it's easier to get to know me through listening to my beauty talking to me sometime.
00:52:57 [W] What do you think of the switch from LA to Nashville for AllMusic?
00:53:04 [W] I'm happy about it because it's more work for me.
00:53:05 [W] I'll take it. I think everything in life is cyclical.
00:53:13 [W] So, you know, it comes and goes it just happens to be a hi.
00:53:17 [W] Time for stuff to come to and through Nashville.
00:53:26 [W] So I'm grateful to be here in Nashville.
00:53:28 [W] I didn't think I'd be here as long as I have been I've been here almost I've been in the area for about 20 years. Exactly.
00:53:34 [W] Actually, I think I think 20 years to the day is when I got here in Nashville.
00:53:43 [W] So probably 20 years to this moment actually.
00:53:46 [W] Let's say go home or against. What is one thing people would be shocked about Tori. I if it's not what the movies make it at least not in the cases that I've been I'm sure there are.
00:53:59 [W] some situation board wild and crazy but
00:54:02 [W] It's not worth everybody.
00:54:06 [W] Patrese to be always it can be boring if you don't make something of it.
00:54:16 [W] of it. Let's see.
00:54:17 [W] Let's see.
00:54:19 [W] I just don't take a couple more in all day.
00:54:24 [W] Tell me to stop.
00:54:28 [W] Do I also work in the studio musician all of the time? I love playing the studio.
00:54:39 [W] I love creating in the studio.
00:54:41 [W] I do a lot of recording here at my home.
00:54:48 [W] But yeah, I love being in the studio.
00:54:50 [W] I've done a lot of work.
00:54:52 [W] I have a playlist on Spotify things. I've played on.
00:54:54 [W] So it's been I think there are probably about.
00:54:59 [W] At this point two hundred-plus songs that have been released that played on the studio.
00:55:06 [W] So I love it.
00:55:07 [W] I got five minutes.
00:55:10 [W] So I'll try to speed through some of these favorite venues. My favorite venues the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, Tennessee, very very special.
00:55:22 [W] I love it.
00:55:25 [W] I will actually be playing there tomorrow with an artist named Yola for some TV things.
00:55:34 [W] We're doing Late Night with Seth Meyers coming up also gramming salute to
00:55:38 [W] I don't know if I'm supposed to say, you know, so I'll leave that.
00:55:44 [W] What else I love the Sydney Opera House in Sydney Australia.
00:55:49 [W] I've been there I've played there.
00:55:52 [W] so many of the I love the small weather relatively small theaters in the US and then that's an awesome circuit to play on and also
00:56:08 [W] I played in so many different video in so many different venues.
00:56:16 [W] I've played in a bullfighting ring and because all this pain that was very cool played in.
00:56:17 [W] Roman Amphitheater in VN friends.
00:56:22 [W] That was very cool.
00:56:29 [W] I loaded it and also like small rooms to where you can feel the energy.
00:56:32 [W] Anywhere, there's music happening.
00:56:35 [W] Well, not anywhere. I like a lot of different venues.
00:56:39 [W] All right.
00:56:43 [W] I got three minutes.
00:56:46 [W] Let's see what else is happening.
00:56:46 [W] Let's see.
00:56:51 [W] Do you find it hard to balance writing performing songs that you enjoy versus what your audience likes?
00:57:02 [W] Absolutely.
00:57:05 [W] Yeah, it's difficult sometimes because there are things that I like to say things are like to communicate I started making music to communicate messages. And so sometimes it gets
00:57:18 [W] tiresome
00:57:20 [W] trying to find the balance between let me write and say what I want to say versus.
00:57:26 [W] Let me make sure that I'm keeping the audience engaged and I challenged myself to keep the audience engaged through my own stuff.
00:57:42 [W] So sometimes it's easy to kind of fall back and let me play Stevie Wonder's Superstition everybody dance or 24K magic and that's fine.
00:57:51 [W] But if I look at it, this is cheating sometimes too. I mean, it's great because I like to serve people good.
00:57:54 [W] I also like to challenge myself to see if I can get the same engagement from songs that people have never heard before me.
00:58:03 [W] Have I ever played in the Netherlands? Yes, I have.
00:58:05 [W] Yes, I have a number of times.
00:58:09 [W] I've enjoyed it.
00:58:10 [W] It's been great.
00:58:12 [W] Let's see anything Adams anything else about 2 minutes?
00:58:19 [W] What new artist in my liking right now?
00:58:34 [W] There's a guy named Scott mulvihill who you should listen to he's one of my absolute favorite writers is also a good friend of mine.
00:58:35 [W] He actually sang it my way.
00:58:40 [W] So it's got more video for sure.
00:58:43 [W] Awesome you thank you.
00:58:44 [W] Thanks for the love.
00:58:50 [W] How did you meet the band play music with just being around in town some of the guys like the guy who's playing the other keyboards with me.
00:58:54 [W] I've known I met him in college some people I met in college some
00:58:56 [W] Auditing session some people I met on the road just being around Nashville.
00:59:03 [W] There are great musicians everywhere.
00:59:05 [W] The people serving you food, probably a great decision.
00:59:12 [W] So that's how it works.
00:59:16 [W] My assistants who gets on thank y'all for the good times. We had a great time.
00:59:19 [W] That's my time.
