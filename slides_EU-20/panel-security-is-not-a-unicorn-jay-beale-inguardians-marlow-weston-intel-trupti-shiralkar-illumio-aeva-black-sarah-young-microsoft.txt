00:05:40 [W] Hi, welcome to the panel security is not a unicorn.
00:12:13 [W] We're here to talk about security and HPC and we've got a great panel. So I'd like to let everyone just introduce themselves and you understand why we're here.
00:12:21 [W] So Ava why don't you go first?
00:12:27 [W] Okay.
00:12:27 [W] Thanks.
00:12:31 [W] So my name is Ava black have been a systems Architects developer admin database admin for on and off about 20 years now and in open source for about 15 of that about 9:00 or so years ago.
00:12:43 [W] I started working on openstack and ended up building and running the open second Raonic project which serverless HPC a lot of bare metal users that was sort of the the initial products that we launched.
00:12:53 [W] HP with that and how it's too late to use concern so I learned a lot about the intersection of cloud and HPC back then and today I'm working at Azure in the confidential Computing department where I'm working a lot more with security stuff.
00:13:09 [W] Excellent, Marlo.
00:13:12 [W] What are you going to next?
00:13:17 [W] Hi, my name is Marla Weston. I have worked at a variety of different companies including HP National Sandia Laboratories Red Storm and now it until the HPC tools group.
00:13:27 [W] Red Storm, and now it until the HPC tools group.
00:13:33 [W] And in that time I've done all sorts of things from bed at all the way up insecurities and I started looking at kubernative use about a year and a half ago and how interacted with HPC and ended up here.
00:13:40 [W] Cool cool eager to learn Sarah.
00:13:48 [W] Hey, my name's Sarah Young.
00:13:50 [W] I'm a senior program manager at Microsoft Azure to I do security engineering stuff.
00:13:57 [W] I've been working in infrastructure engineering for my entire career.
00:14:06 [W] I really love kubenetes containers and how we do security better and a cloud native environment. So yeah really excited to be here.
00:14:07 [W] Awesome Arlo. I'm sorry Pirlo troop see hi everyone.
00:14:16 [W] My name is Trudy. I'm a mobile game developer don't security professional with more than 13 years of experience in software security and applied cryptography.
00:14:23 [W] Currently.
00:14:26 [W] I'm working as a principal application security engineer at a security startup known as Ali Mayo who builds micro segmentation products for data centers and end points. I came to this panel because I'm extremely curious.
00:14:39 [W] Serious about high performance Computing base applications and system their role in making the humanity better and the unique security challenges HPC systems face while mitigating these challenges and threats the
00:14:53 [W] Education security engineer at a security startup known as Ali Mayo who builds micro segmentation products for data centers and end points.
00:14:54 [W] I came to this panel because I'm extremely curious about high performance Computing base applications and system their role in making the humanity better and the unique security challenges HPC systems face while
00:14:56 [W] How to strike a balance between performance and security fascinates me and that's exactly why I'm here. Awesome.
00:15:04 [W] Well, I'm JBL. I'm going to be moderating today.
00:15:07 [W] I'm the CTO over it in Guardians.
00:15:17 [W] And we do a ton of communities penetration testing and other kinds of security work and I teach a black hat class that involves attacking and defending kubernative and
00:15:22 [W] Here to learn how security and how Securities a challenge in the HPC world.
00:15:34 [W] And so I'm really eager to really go to start.
00:15:36 [W] So let's take it away then so we're here to talk about the challenges that come up and high performance Computing or HPC.
00:15:44 [W] So so why is this difficult enough that you've come to a panel on it? What kinds of technical challenges does HPC put on the standard kubernative?
00:15:52 [W] t Security practices and the best practices
00:15:55 [W] I can take some of that.
00:16:03 [W] So HPC classic HPC you have a front.
00:16:04 [W] Load friend job scheduler and to go past the jobscheduler.
00:16:13 [W] That's for the job sir run. So unlike Cloud native where everybody has access to their pods who don't have access to their jobs while they're running like you can look at log files, which you can't access the job actively in Cloud native.
00:16:25 [W] It's completely different format where you can access and when you start looking at say networking or storage it's the layout in how it works in Cloud native is very different than how it
00:16:35 [W] Tekton HPC. So in Cloud native you have namespaces and cgroup so you don't have those with classic HPC and additionally when you when you're looking at for instance your C&I or network layer, you don't have
00:16:50 [W] Excuse me, so you can just go sniff the traffic going around and also your job is scheduled first particular notes.
00:16:58 [W] You're not going to be there listening to other people's jobs that may be on the same node.
00:17:06 [W] So when you start looking at those things and you add encryption on you realize oh my goodness.
00:17:06 [W] this performance at I'm getting just on getting the network if I want to do encryption if you have a much different world,
00:17:14 [W] Yeah, absolutely.
00:17:18 [W] It sounds like it sounds like kubenetes is creating a lot more capability, but it's also creating a lot more.
00:17:25 [W] It's also destroying some of the assumptions that have existed in HPC. Is that right?
00:17:30 [W] Yes very much.
00:17:34 [W] Cool. Well, so is is kubernative solving a unique technical problem here. I mean is as we as we look at how you do security in the high performance Computing
00:17:51 [W] What's the kind of heard where things have been traditionally?
00:17:58 [W] Is? Anybody tried to solve this problem before?
00:17:59 [W] That one yeah open Stock went through a phase as started to mature and a lot of existing company is already to science places started trying to use it for large workloads.
00:18:16 [W] And a lot of existing company is already to science places started trying to use it for large workloads.
00:18:17 [W] I had one time sort of the early days of that was that one of our conferences and a grad student, you know, some some one ran out look like a developer and today. I'm a grad student at
00:18:29 [W] Ed student, you know some some one ran out look like a developer. And today I'm a grad student at it was University of medicine and our entire remember correctly or not cancer research lab is running now using ironic
00:18:38 [W] I don't know thousand two thousand machines was a big cluster.
00:18:43 [W] Really impressive numbers and we talked a little bit about the workload and not a typical workloads.
00:18:56 [W] Geon a cloud back then or today jobs were scheduled differently and I learned a fair bit then about you know how that the job scheduling is quite different than in a normal Cloud
00:19:09 [W] Got ya.
00:19:13 [W] I'd like to I'd like to understand how things how things are different. Like what are what are some of the let's just let's get a little practical.
00:19:25 [W] What is some of the workload types that are that are unique to HPC, you know, we talk about high performance Computing.
00:19:29 [W] What is that?
00:19:30 [W] What?
00:19:32 [W] Okay, absolutely.
00:19:34 [W] One of the example I could think about is astrophysics or scientific computations happening on Corona vaccine data.
00:19:45 [W] Well, that's that's Timely.
00:19:48 [W] So you have it you have a few different types of jobs, right?
00:19:55 [W] So some of them are very much was called embarrassingly parallel.
00:19:56 [W] And when you say embarrassingly parallel, you can split it up into a whole bunch of little jobs and they kind of run independently.
00:20:03 [W] they don't have to talk to each other and then there's ones where you need communication and between the different components to do each step.
00:20:13 [W] So a lot with machine learning as an example for training they have to talk to each other.
00:20:18 [W] It's a distributed computation when you're talking inference. It's not
00:20:22 [W] With astrophysics, there's some jobs that will be one way and some that'll be another with the HPC the ones that become challenging are not the ones that are embarrassingly parallel. There were ones that involve the communication.
00:20:39 [W] So we saw a lot of folks trying to add to openstack Hardware support to accelerate that sort of network communication using PC. I pass through or SSL offload cards for TCP offload cards
00:20:55 [W] Higher level ization of workloads as they're communicating across nodes.
00:21:01 [W] And today we're seeing similar stuff around cartography.
00:21:05 [W] Well, it sounds like you might have something you might have. A lot of need to have to have a really fast communication on those non embarrassingly parallel ones. You'll need a lot of fast low latency communication
00:21:21 [W] Between between parts of the workload is that mean the schedulers are trying to keep a lot of the job on the same, you know the same set of machines whether those are like in the same
00:21:37 [W] Center or maybe even on the same machine
00:21:40 [W] Yeah, a lot of so some some work was done in the openstack scheduler, which was eventually made pluggable and people were able to build different scheduling algorithms for different types of workloads.
00:22:12 [W] I can see why is for their workloads, which is not something that's as important in a you know public cloud.
00:22:19 [W] Probably myself really wanting to learn more about that. But I guess we're we're on the security.
00:22:33 [W] We're going to Security in HBC panel. So I guess I should focus as focuses their so, okay.
00:22:33 [W] So kubernative security is just by itself rather hard topic there are lots of sessions this conference talking just about security.
00:22:47 [W] We're all you know, we're all having a times really strong assumptions about how much Security's already
00:22:49 [W] Defaults and then running into that hard is H does HPC make these security code, you know the security goals and using those controls more difficult.
00:23:04 [W] Latency wise for their workloads, which is not something that's as important in a you know public cloud.
00:23:08 [W] Well, I'm finding myself really wanting to learn more about that. But I guess we're we're on the security.
00:23:09 [W] We're going to security nhpc panel. So I guess I should focus as Focus as there so, okay.
00:23:10 [W] So kubernative security is just by itself rather hard topic there are lots of sessions this conference talking just about security.
00:23:14 [W] We're all you know, we're all having a times really strong assumptions about how much Security's already big
00:23:15 [W] Defaults and then running into that hard is H does HPC make these security code, you know the security goals and using the controls more difficult.
00:23:18 [W] I'm going to have to jump in here seeing as I've been quiet so far. So, okay. So you're right there are tons and you know throughout the whole of this conference is going to be heaps of talks on how you do kubernative security.
00:23:19 [W] So you're right there are tons and you know throughout the whole of this conference is going to be heaps of talks on how you do kubernative security.
00:23:21 [W] Well and I think my comment here rather than specifically on HBC is to remind people that I don't think we know how to do kubernative security super.
00:23:25 [W] Well.
00:23:33 [W] Well. Yeah, I don't think anyone does you probably know yourself jfrog pentesting kubenetes and things that people don't always set it up amazingly. Well, so when we don't set up our kubernative well,
00:23:37 [W] And then we're going to run an HPC environment on top in my opinion. It can only add additional complexity. But you know, I don't think I just think my point is that you shouldn't we shouldn't just one we're talking about this
00:23:52 [W] Only add additional complexity but you know, I don't think I just think my point is that you shouldn't we shouldn't just one we're talking about this question. Don't forget about what's underneath because I don't think we've really got
00:23:57 [W] Get about what's underneath because I don't think we've really got 100% there with what's underpinning this HPC and then we're going to have to put some more on top.
00:24:07 [W] I'll let someone else chime in on to you specifically what you may need to consider for each PC though or it sounds like Elsa the challenges of what you don't get to have potentially.
00:24:14 [W] Well, yeah.
00:24:14 [W] Yeah exactly.
00:24:16 [W] That's what I'm worried about.
00:24:20 [W] I would like to jump in here. First of all, I would like to say that just focusing on
00:24:22 [W] hang on kubernative security is not sufficient to protect entire end-to-end stack of HPC while kubernative leaves is super important and we need to secure it because kubernative is is kind of the default
00:24:37 [W] Some include knative Cloud as well as it's the part of infrastructure. We also need to take a look at the application security side of HPC. We need to make sure that the existing architecture and design kind of
00:24:53 [W] School through technological means we also want to make sure to perform activities like threat modeling who are are threats.
00:25:05 [W] who are the threat agents are we actually protecting rhpc against those threats agents and I would like to mention here recently.
00:25:15 [W] We just saw how far in state actors are targeting us biotech firms who are performing research on covid-19 vaccines. So are you actually protecting your
00:25:24 [W] HP systems against those relevant threats. If not, there is some soul-searching we need to do there besides threat modeling.
00:25:38 [W] I also want to mention about the code security. Are you making sure the code that goes as part of HPC you are securing that and not just code but the third party open source libraries framework because
00:25:48 [W] Being a third party Library can create a big security impact.
00:25:54 [W] Do you guys remember the unpatch struts server resulted in Equifax reach?
00:25:59 [W] Yeah, lastly I would like to say that get your HP systems externally a pen tester using export third-party vendors such as yours J. That's also extremely important because you know,
00:26:14 [W] Students externally open test are using export third-party vendors such as yours J. That's also extremely important because you know, you never know what kind of findings these creative pen testers will come up
00:26:19 [W] What kind of findings these creative pen testers will come up that blue team a not able to identify in timely fashion? So while for traditional non Computing HPC system setting up is setting up
00:26:30 [W] Yup is setting up and typical application security program is quite a standard practice.
00:26:34 [W] That's not the case. I have seen with Classic Edge BC. So we might want to pay attention there.
00:26:40 [W] It sounds like some of what some of what you've brought up just now is especially when we especially when we're thinking about the recent the recent attacks trying to get covid back seen work HPC environments.
00:26:56 [W] I thought of some of the risks as a little more theoretical or things that happen rarely enough that maybe we can kind of put that off till later there.
00:27:10 [W] It sounds like I might be coming up a lot right now. It's a juicy Target.
00:27:13 [W] One thing I'd like to jump in with is when you start talking about libraries being compromised. You have to be careful with each PC because these are real scientific numbers coming out and you don't want to change your number. So if someone upgrades a library and then while they're at it, you know, fixes some sort of
00:27:29 [W] It's so different.
00:27:45 [W] So in this case I can think about a security trade off like instead of upgrading the libraries to the latest greatest security version which can which can introduce our diversion or performance hint we can think about access control mechanism so
00:27:46 [W] Was our diversion or performance hint we can think about access control mechanism so that we can limit the exploitability factor to that vulnerable library in this way.
00:27:54 [W] We do a security trade off to make sure HP system is secure and intact Ripley.
00:28:02 [W] I think you're talking about software Supply Chain management.
00:28:02 [W] Yes.
00:28:04 [W] Yeah.
00:28:05 [W] that's that's really important and nhpc workloads not.
00:28:10 [W] As mother was saying not just upgrading automatically, you know and kubernative. We might rebuild our image for every deployment rebuilt might be kind of automatic and HPC.
00:28:23 [W] It's really not the norm to rebuild on the Fly.
00:28:32 [W] There's often. I've seen A Change Control process a lot more auditing or inspection of the image buildpacks s that goes into that that might even in a research setting or university be done the same thing might also
00:28:38 [W] It's not sort of cloud native.
00:28:43 [W] Yeah, absolutely. And I know a that you've done a ton of work in software supply chain Marlo what you've said scares me a little bit like just realizing realizing that when when you're looking when you've got that standard when you're doing science when you're doing
00:28:58 [W] And clinical work.
00:29:03 [W] You've got to get the same darn numbers every time and so Library upgrades Library upgrades can be dangerous. But often that's the only way a patch happens.
00:29:10 [W] Wow, okay.
00:29:22 [W] So I think we can you know, we can talk about different kinds of controls and I'm eager to kind of eager to hear what helps the most but I keep thinking from what you've
00:29:28 [W] Actually when you talk about the way HPC is traditionally been done and how things get a lot different when you're bringing when you bring this to kubernative. When you bring it to Cloud native that there that it's going to be a different cultural. Well, it's a different going to be different culture. So
00:29:44 [W] Addition of the technical challenges are there cultural hurdles to Bringing security to HPC.
00:29:52 [W] Absolutely.
00:29:57 [W] I mean, usually HPC people aren't used to thinking about security except for that front the front jobscheduler, right?
00:30:02 [W] Maybe they're not thinking about all the other pieces and when you start talking about kubernative, especially since a lot of the people have been in the field for 30 40 years you see them freeze up because the completely different model.
00:30:12 [W] But what you do see is a big push with the younger generation because they don't want to have to sit and think about how all the things are compiled on their individual system because often with the HPC stuff. It's compiled for the specific system.
00:30:29 [W] They are running on whereas in containers, you can expect you know, a certain type of computation because it's a container it statically built off in with libraries. If you're using go language going the for instance a lot of the mlperf.
00:30:43 [W] FBI stuff they're going more and more towards static libraries.
00:30:49 [W] So it's just a completely different world.
00:30:51 [W] And so you see a lot of head butting as far as people going back and forth.
00:30:57 [W] However some places and I believe Ava knows more than I do have moved towards more Cloud native type environment starting with openstack.
00:31:04 [W] Why can't I do that now or you know transposing their their prior assumptions on to a system like openstack or kubernetes and those assumptions mean they're not doing the right Security checks anymore.
00:31:31 [W] I'll just jump in there too. Because you know, this is as ever was saying this is something that comes up time and time and time again, you know people take when you introduce something that's new or has a different structure
00:31:43 [W] It's brand-new technology, whatever often people will take old security rules and apply them to the new technology whether or not that is valid or not.
00:31:54 [W] It's just what people tend to do the like it's basically an application.
00:31:58 [W] So we'll just use all the same tools controls Etc and it'll be fine and you inevitably end up with gaps. So I don't even think I know we're talking about it in with the neat PC lens, but it's something that we see time and time again
00:32:11 [W] And that's why security so hard because it's not just the technical side of things.
00:32:19 [W] In fact, it's probably easier in a way than the cultural things the cultural changes that have to happen whether it's a team applying old principles and Technologies or it's a team like Marlo was saying that he's never had to do security
00:32:33 [W] Applying old principles and Technologies or it's a team like Marlo was saying that he's never had to do security before so they don't see why it's relevant. It's a massive massive massive challenge, really really really tough.
00:32:40 [W] I would say, you know, we all being the security champions We need to be the change that we would like to see in our team's departments or organization and I can't put enough emphasis on educating all
00:32:56 [W] Leader technical developers or scientist, but the business books as well on the impact of breaches through, you know security awareness training by empowering them with the right Tools in this case.
00:33:11 [W] There are tons of open source security tools available that we can integrate in kubernative ci/cd pipeline in that way security doesn't become a hindrance for their innovation.
00:33:22 [W] So by doing that we kind of giving our people a chance to change and when they know the change is kind of coming from a Caring Heart where we understand their pain points their
00:33:37 [W] Our people a chance to change and when they know the change is kind of coming from a Caring Heart where we understand their pain points their business deadlines.
00:33:40 [W] They get it. They don't necessarily feel challenge.
00:33:43 [W] Exactly, you mentioned tools and I wanted to bring up some tools. Right I've seen in the hardware space to sort of my playground.
00:33:54 [W] Several years back.
00:33:58 [W] We had a lot of work in openstack and I know kubernative done similar around PCI pass through and Numa topologies or Numa where schedulers take advantage of specific types of Hardware you the same thing with gpus for machine learning and HPC
00:34:11 [W] Offload mentioned that we're now seeing right and yet another tool with svx or arm trust zones Hardware trusted execution environments for enclaves creating a sort of partitioned section
00:34:27 [W] Dissection the processor to do computation so that it can be encrypted in use in addition to encrypted at rest and an encrypted in transit.
00:34:40 [W] And so I think we have you know, every couple years new tools are added to the tool belts of Security Experts in specifically in the HPC space here.
00:34:49 [W] I'd like to I'd like to talk about tools a little bit.
00:34:53 [W] That sounds that sounds really night the secure Enclave just you know for
00:34:55 [W] For those for those of us, you know for whom that's pretty new stuff secure Enclave basically gets us to the point where I can have I can have I can have multiple workloads. Multiple High, you know, is this
00:35:11 [W] Just you know for for those for those of us, you know, for whom that's pretty new stuff secure Enclave basically gets us to the point where I can have I can have I can have multiple workloads. Multiple High, you know.
00:35:13 [W] Privilege workloads on a system and they wouldn't be able to see each other or they would be able to Snoop on each other as it were in theory of virtual machine boundary.
00:35:20 [W] does that but the the VM boundary isn't protected from a malicious root user or malicious firmware on the host.
00:35:35 [W] Whereas a secure Enclave is right, even if your neighbor someone pops out of that they're shallow pops out of their VM get screwed on the host The Enclave is still protected because even the route can't
00:35:41 [W] access it.
00:35:42 [W] Nice will call its talk about let's talk about other tools or let's talk about honestly, I want understand where you have to make the trade-offs.
00:35:54 [W] You know, where are the places where where we just say?
00:36:00 [W] Well, okay. So you're in a you know, you're in a PCI environment you're quiet.
00:36:03 [W] So that means you're required to encrypt All Transport.
00:36:10 [W] Is that a is that a difficult in HPC like where are the where two things get difficult here? The classic HPC. It's it's not a problem.
00:36:16 [W] You don't have to encrypt the traffic and transport right now.
00:36:18 [W] So protected because even the route can't access it.
00:36:44 [W] Nice will call its talk about let's talk about other tools or let's talk about honestly, I want understand where you have to make the trade-offs.
00:36:45 [W] You know, where are the places where where we just say?
00:36:46 [W] Well, okay. So you're in a you know, you're in a PCI environment you're quiet.
00:36:47 [W] So that means you're required to encrypt All Transport.
00:36:48 [W] Is that a is that a difficult in HPC like where are the where things get difficult here?
00:36:49 [W] The classic HPC. It's it's not a problem.
00:36:50 [W] You don't have to encrypt the traffic and transport right now.
00:36:56 [W] If you look at the cni-genie, there are two Pella Cohen, we've met I believe that have encryption enabled your performance tanks. So they're not really good options for doing it corruption at this time.
00:36:57 [W] So if someone no one has yet and I'm Intel uses something like the q80 cards which are on the pcie bus and uses that for your encryption layer.
00:36:59 [W] Ooh, one of these cni-genie get better performance, but no one's done these things yet, because that hasn't been necessarily A Thing.
00:37:01 [W] They've been looking at kubernative is still fairly new so we don't have this Vamps as advanced tools as you do elsewhere.
00:37:02 [W] Gotcha.
00:37:04 [W] So where are other places where are the places where there are challenges you have to make trade-offs there any cool tricks cold tricks or tested techniques you found that help here.
00:37:16 [W] So one of the example I could think about is when you're processing terabytes or petabytes of sensitive information performance is extremely important for latency-sensitive application. One of the example I could think about is
00:37:30 [W] These cni-genie can get better performance, but no one's done these things yet, because that hasn't been necessarily A Thing.
00:37:31 [W] They've been looking at kubenetes is still fairly new so we don't have this fantasy as advanced tools as you do elsewhere.
00:37:32 [W] Gotcha.
00:37:32 [W] So where are other places where are the places where there are challenges you have to make trade-offs there any cool tricks cold tricks or tested techniques you found that help here.
00:37:34 [W] So one of the example I could think about is when you're processing terabytes or petabytes of sensitive information performance is extremely important for latency-sensitive application. One of the example I could think about is
00:37:36 [W] A simple credit card search operation where you need to decrypt billions of encrypted credit card information match the right credit card record and written that information in this particular scenario.
00:37:46 [W] Just the simple operation of decrypting billions of credit card.
00:37:51 [W] It's going to give hit from performance perspective.
00:37:55 [W] Now, we have couple of ways to deal with this situation. The first thing I could think about is you can
00:38:00 [W] up your credit card information in plain text information and really apply strong Access Control to prevent any unauthorized access maybe using some of the micro segmentation technique or role-based Access Control technique, but in this
00:38:15 [W] You meet the performance, but you are losing on compliance and security but you make that trade-off.
00:38:26 [W] Another thing I can think about is you can go more security Innovative side.
00:38:33 [W] where along with stooping the encrypted credit card information. You also store is simple edgemax sha-256 tokenize value and perform you're searching against the tokenize value which is
00:38:44 [W] You any performance penalty in this way.
00:38:54 [W] You don't have to worry about any security trade off and you still your performance as well as security requirements.
00:38:59 [W] So in each PC World, it's really going to vary from application to application case depending on the architecture and business use case.
00:39:06 [W] feel Jay.
00:39:07 [W] Yeah, and just just to add to that.
00:39:13 [W] I mean when we talk about trade-offs, we always talk about trade-offs and security.
00:39:14 [W] I mean all the time so and I know that particularly technical people will roll their eyes a little bit when I start talking about saying you have to assess the risk and it's a risk-based approach, but it is a reality so, you know whenever we
00:39:28 [W] Technical decisions in security. There's often a trade-off.
00:39:41 [W] So if I do this either I spend loads more money or performance is going to take a hair and and it's always a risk based decision. Now, I'm not saying that people who are listening to this necessarily need to make that call like push it back to your security teams and some
00:39:49 [W] Special technical risk teams whose job it is to make make the decision on behalf of the business.
00:39:59 [W] Certainly you want someone who gets paid enough to take responsibility for that decision, which probably isn't a technical person, but what you can do as an engineer or an architect someone helping with that is help the risk people and the decision makers
00:40:11 [W] Was in cons of each decision, you know, if we do this, you know, it might be more likely that this attack would happen. But but we're saving 10 million dollars or whatever. It is and companies make those trade-offs all the
00:40:26 [W] And I don't think it's a bad thing.
00:40:30 [W] It's just life.
00:40:33 [W] But as long as all the decision makers are well informed and know the facts of what's the likelihood of this happening.
00:40:38 [W] What's the impact?
00:40:43 [W] I think that's the best we can do and I do think that I'm not saying anyone here go away and learn risk management.
00:40:49 [W] Please don't but it we do sometimes forget that as technical people.
00:40:50 [W] We do have a responsibility to help non-technical stakeholders and decision makers understand what
00:40:57 [W] What they're being asked to choose between I do think we forget that and again HPC and everything else and security but I like to talk about it because it always comes up.
00:41:06 [W] A true make sense to me.
00:41:12 [W] It sounds like there's a lot. It sounds like HPC puts us into a much more complex place as somebody who you know somebody who's playing the attacker almost all the time.
00:41:19 [W] I'm lucky enough that and I think a lot of a lot of security people are like this.
00:41:30 [W] I'm lucky enough to just say you should do these you should do these 10 things if you want to stop what I just did and not have to consider what those trade-offs are and why when I come back that hair,
00:41:38 [W] Do some of those or they may different or they chose compensating controls or what have you that sounds that sounds like this gets like it's important everywhere like you're saying Sarah and maybe this gets more complex and HPC world.
00:41:51 [W] Lucky enough that and I think a lot of a lot of security people are like this.
00:41:57 [W] I'm lucky enough to just say you should do these you should do these ten things if you want to stop what I just did and not have to consider what those trade-offs are and why when I come back they didn't do some of those or they may
00:41:58 [W] These take responsibility for what decision is made there.
00:42:02 [W] They're getting paid a lot more than I am.
00:42:15 [W] So, you know and that's why ultimately you take more responsibility as you go up the chain, but as you rightly point out the more layers of complexity because I've just been doing very this all that decisions in reality.
00:42:17 [W] It might be this or that or that or that or that but there can be lots of different options.
00:42:22 [W] Wow, and I have a lot to learn here.
00:42:27 [W] Okay, so as we think about as we as we think about this is we talked about this.
00:42:33 [W] I just keep coming back to that to that question of the you know of how the culture is different and also how kubernative sand Cloud native has made things different for the HPC folks
00:42:46 [W] back to that to that question of the you know of how the culture is different and also how kubenetes and Cloud native has made things different for the HPC folks and for all of us
00:42:48 [W] Some and how much it changes. So what I'd like to ask is if you could give one piece of advice to HPC folks who are who are really looking at security Beyond,
00:43:02 [W] we see folks who are who are really looking at security Beyond, you know beyond their traditional model for the first time or you could talk to security people who are having to deal with HPC for the first time like what would you what would you want us to learn
00:43:11 [W] Dirty people who are having to deal with HPC for the first time like what would you what would you want us to learn and share? And what would you share?
00:43:13 [W] You know, it takes a village to build a good security program and it takes time change is hard.
00:43:28 [W] So we need to be patient and if I have to answer your question, what is that? One thing that I would like to implement to make sure HPC systems are secure is shift your security towards left as much as possible to build
00:43:37 [W] label holistic security program
00:43:40 [W] and just building on that to me like no one does like it's really don't beat yourself up. If you don't know security, especially if you're just coming into it for the first time because everything the scale the rate of change
00:43:57 [W] The none other Technologies is so immense that it's actually normal not to know everything and that's the same for security as well.
00:44:10 [W] So I think it's really important that you know, people don't beat themselves up with they don't know everything because I do think this we have a little bit of a culture problem sometimes in technical technical spheres where it's like, oh, yeah.
00:44:19 [W] know this I've never done it before but you know to admit that I don't know. This is seen as like throwing shade on my technical ability so I won't say
00:44:30 [W] I don't know it and I'll just try and muddle through security isn't one of the things where you want to do that and I were actually wouldn't like recommend that project for any kind of Technology by the way, but, you know, if you don't know something that's okay go on us to help reach out
00:44:42 [W] top Specialists because there's always someone else who will know it at least better than you if you need help and that's okay and I do I have seen people get and and organizations get into real models for one of her but front for one of a nice
00:44:58 [W] Loading because they haven't done that and and they've just modeled through and without really knowing what they were doing and it can really end up in a mess.
00:45:09 [W] No, I work at a large cloud provider and I have worked in other ones before but I'd still say with the state of kubernative is right now if you can it's more secure to run it on your own hardware and your own data center in a non multi-tenant environment.
00:45:27 [W] Don't I don't know that we really have good secure multi-tenancy.
00:45:34 [W] Yes in kubenetes do need to use a public cloud or many public clouds still run. If you can single tenant right single tenant probably under differently in different Cloud providers, but don't share your
00:45:47 [W] Anyone with any other other kubernative don't you trippin? He's controlling with other users with their customers. Sorry the biggest vulnerability I've seen.
00:45:58 [W] And to build on that we're in a really exciting time where each PC really isn't developed yet to work on cloud native.
00:46:09 [W] So there's a whole bunch of work that can be done.
00:46:11 [W] There's a whole bunch of tools that can be done we can imagine what we want it to look like and as an example, we could start using the Kuwaiti cards as a accelerator for TLS so that you have faster crypto traffic.
00:46:24 [W] There's a whole bunch of things. We could build just like that is an example.
00:46:30 [W] To get this where it needs to be but it's not where it needs to be.
00:46:36 [W] So you really can't run securely except in a single tenant environment at this time.
00:46:39 [W] Yeah.
00:46:40 [W] I love that.
00:46:42 [W] I love I mean it sounds so that sounds so much like the spirit of Open Source.
00:46:48 [W] It's not it's not quite ready yet.
00:46:49 [W] And that's great.
00:46:51 [W] That's the challenge we get to build and Sarah. I feel like what you've said about, you know, don't try to fake like you.
00:47:00 [W] know it all don't think that you know, don't worry that you're expected to whether you're you know, whether you're super senior in your field or whether you're new to this and that's I feel like that's really really it's really really good advice that the great thing about kubenetes
00:47:13 [W] Nobody's expecting you to know everything and nail it all. This is moving so fast, we're changing.
00:47:22 [W] We're changing so much and heck nobody's in the nobody's been in this for six years.
00:47:35 [W] So there's a yeah, I just I feel like this is really great.
00:47:42 [W] I feel like honestly what I what I'm taking away from this panel is I've learned some and I have a lot more to learn so
00:47:43 [W] so I'm I'm eager to go learn and and then see if I can contribute.
00:47:49 [W] Well, thank you very much.
00:47:52 [W] Thanks. Everyone is everyone so everybody thanks Jay.
00:47:58 [W] By and now we've lost our great green screen backgrounds.
00:48:10 [W] And so this is us and it's it's time for real.
00:48:14 [W] Well, okay, so hi everybody, I guess we can just laugh.
00:48:25 [W] I feel like we should introduce ourselves but we have just been we have just all been live. So I guess I'll skip that so we had a we've had a few questions come in one was the one of those was
00:48:31 [W] Some the some Enterprises in order.
00:48:36 [W] Get stronger and stronger.
00:48:49 [W] So what would be the impact of that on HBC environments?
00:48:51 [W] Where have been already starting to talk about challenges are looking to take the first swing at that?
00:48:55 [W] Yeah, sure basically with HPC environments. You have to be really careful about performance.
00:49:07 [W] So if you're going to Upstream stuff, like encrypting all of your traffic without using an accelerator, they're not going to use you but is also going to impact your other types of jobs.
00:49:19 [W] So you need to be careful about what those security default to Upstream if you just have policies on who can access what that's a completely different matter if you have policies.
00:49:25 [W] On your storage and who how those accesses work and it's not impacting your performance.
00:49:40 [W] That's not going to matter. If there's a minor impact on your performance then they might they might use you anyways, because HPC honestly does care about security.
00:49:43 [W] It's just the environment is completely different than their classic environments here.
00:49:47 [W] It's going to come at all.
00:49:53 [W] So last year, I spent some time chatting with folks about getting more secure defaults and kubenetes of the biggest challenges.
00:50:02 [W] You know secure by default as well encrypt everywhere and suddenly everything slows down that can be just as effectively breaking.
00:50:27 [W] of the work that folks are doing in this phase is to enable more security with easy options.
00:50:28 [W] It's room group the options together or look at other ways to turn all this on, but you do still have to have to choose to opt in.
00:50:36 [W] Yeah, listen, uh, can we like minute go through hit Sarah, please?
00:50:46 [W] Yeah. So first of all, hi, I'll apologize for the first time in my dressing gown.
00:50:48 [W] It is 4:00 a.m. Where I am right now.
00:50:48 [W] Hello.
00:50:55 [W] The only thing I want to add that was I just wanted to highlight.
00:51:01 [W] is the classic thing about security being singing sometimes as a business broker because and the challenge that we always have in a security sense is the
00:51:08 [W] If you try to make things more secure, that's great.
00:51:13 [W] But if you either break something or you reduce the productivity, then it's no good.
00:51:20 [W] And like Angel was saying that's such a difficult thing and that's probably why most security people are going to have jobs forever because it's it's I think it's it's always a trade-off and yeah,
00:51:30 [W] Dressing gown it is 4:00 a.m. Where I am right now.
00:51:31 [W] Hello.
00:51:32 [W] The only thing I'm to up there was I just wanted to highlight.
00:51:32 [W] This is the classic thing about security being singing sometimes as a business blocker because and the challenge that we always have in a security sense is that if you try and make things more secure, that's great.
00:51:33 [W] if you either break something or you reduce the productivity then it's no
00:51:35 [W] Oh good and like Angel was saying that's such a difficult thing and that's probably why most security people are going to have jobs forever because it's I think it's it's always a trade-off
00:51:37 [W] Yeah, I'm sure you know what I'm talking about.
00:51:38 [W] gay as someone who doesn't know anything when I as the attacker, it's it's really much.
00:51:43 [W] It's really much.
00:51:44 [W] It's really much easier when I when I got my attacker hat on Marlo and everybody its they're like is this something that we could do with with you know with documentation as well like it can be can you have could
00:51:59 [W] Could you have or with multiple defaults? Like can you have a set of defaults that are for kubermatic and then a set of defaults that are that are for hot that are you know that make a bit of a trade-off but don't throw the baby out with the bathwater on security.
00:52:11 [W] Yeah, so it might be really useful to you know windows and some other not Windows.
00:52:23 [W] Yeah Windows it has power versions, right so you on your laptop so you have for instance full performance, which is everything runs and it's hot and then there's medium performance which doesn't burn through your battery as quickly right so you could have something like that as far as
00:52:34 [W] have something like that as far as pretty faults and kubernative HPC people at least the people setting up your systems will probably be spending a lot of time going through these things but having something just at the start to tweak performance and then be able to slowly turn on features so they can actually see
00:52:46 [W] What the actual performance inspect is by reading their own benchmarks would be highly useful.
00:52:52 [W] Gotcha. Yeah that makes a lot of sense.
00:52:56 [W] That makes a lot of sense to me.
00:53:03 [W] Yeah Ava I know you and I did a project together a few years back with secure, you know with secure defaults for a client that was super concerned about performance.
00:53:13 [W] And yeah, that was it's it's figuring out like how to you had a figuring out how do you make sure that they know that they can do things like that?
00:53:21 [W] They can do things and I don't know I almost wonder almost wonder if what if something that a lot of us want to ask you I know.
00:53:27 [W] I do want to ask you all, you know.
00:53:33 [W] Is there can we just get a list?
00:53:40 [W] Can we get a list of kind of what measures are going to you know, what measures are going to slow things down so much that it's you know, that that could be a danger Will Robinson situation.
00:53:44 [W] You know, I think you've brought up you brought up and you know doing encrypt, you know doing servicemeshcon.
00:53:57 [W] Would be a danger point.
00:53:59 [W] Is there anything else that's absolutely like no, there's no problem with that.
00:54:08 [W] You can totally do that without really a much for performance impact or you know, watch out for this.
00:54:09 [W] And we'll try to go through there. I'd love if we could I'd love if any of you wanted to brainstorm a list. But thank you so much for doing this panel and and for talking to all of us about HPC and security.
00:54:32 [W] Thank you everybody.
00:54:35 [W] Thank you.
