00:02:43 [W] Hi and welcome to what you need to know about openmetrics.
00:09:18 [W] Let's start with who we are.
00:09:22 [W] I'm Brian Russell the founder of robust perception one of the developers of radius, and of course one of the people working on openmetrics.
00:09:27 [W] A title Prometheus up and running and I'm Richie.
00:09:36 [W] I am the community are accurate for fun elapsed.
00:09:41 [W] Also Prometheus team member the chair of the Scopes of ability within cncf and the founder of openmetrics, and we couldn't really be talking about openmetrics without also talking about Prometheus.
00:09:49 [W] So let's look at Prometheus for a minute before Prometheus historically the closest we had which which resembled a common standard within the space of monitoring was SNMP and many of the old Solutions.
00:10:00 [W] These are based on what is today engine technology, like for example is in one which is which is front and center in SNMP. And while this has it's a great piece of engineering but it's not matching the design and Engineering trade-offs of today
00:10:15 [W] Protocols are chatty and slow they tend to be or they can often be prepared very hard to implement or even both and many of the underlying data models.
00:10:28 [W] For example, S&P also models also others tend to encourage vendor specific variations, which follow the letter of the law but not the spirit and one thing which is my one of my largest pet peeves hierarchy of data models because they almost
00:10:40 [W] If you have a thing where you have either on a region customer deployment, but now you need to look at your data by custom or pretty common and this hierarchical data model is basically it's broken as soon as you're done defining.
00:10:56 [W] So let's look at the world after Prometheus for me it is as of today is the de facto standard in Cloud native metric monitoring and Way Beyond and by extension the same is true for the Prometheus Exposition format the ease of exporting this data has led
00:11:09 [W] Incompatible metric and points and we have thousands and thousands of X is borders and Integrations which people wrote on their own for their own stuff just because they wanted to get their stuff into Prometheus cause was so simple. And so powerful. We also have standard
00:11:25 [W] Maurice which make integrating easy and we even going Beyond this by creating a standard set of raising your scaffold where which can use to write your own exporters and not focus on writing HTTP endpoint and making that stuff work but actually
00:11:41 [W] I want to expose about your own stuff and of course label sets allow you to bring up this n dimensional Matrix of how you look at your data. And if you need to slice and dice according to buy customer by deployment by region by version of a
00:11:56 [W] Better you can always access your data precisely as you needed as long as you have the neighbors for it.
00:12:08 [W] There's always tons of politics in any other in any open standard and to be honest quite a few vendors and project had been torn about adopting something which which carries the Prometheus name and
00:12:17 [W] Traditional vendors like especially in the networking space which is many moons ago where I'm coming from. They want to have an official standard whatever that means but obviously wanted to reuse the installed base of Prometheus close a for the ease of adoption and be
00:12:33 [W] Base, but also we want to still reject the kitchen sink approach which some Senators have where it tried to call all you spaces.
00:12:45 [W] We want to follow the Unix mentor of doing one thing.
00:12:50 [W] Well, so we really remained focused and also to be honest quite opinionated opinionated about how to lose things just cause of a lot of experience if I do say so myself in how to run monitoring and observability
00:13:01 [W] Many many different companies have collaborated with in openmetrics and help shape the so I dare say we actually achieved a neutral standard.
00:13:14 [W] We have a ton of commitments and this list is partial of people who actually are of companies who want to adopt openmetrics, but we also have a lot of people or a few people behind this
00:13:25 [W] Nurse who have been at this for quite a few quite some years now.
00:13:33 [W] I've been coaching of gitlab Brian who's in this talk myself rub skeleton formally m 3 DB now chronosphere and honorable mention for someone who dropped two relatively recently, but did a ton of useful very green gave it a ton of
00:13:45 [W] And honorable mention for someone who dropped two relatively recently, but did a ton of useful work in gayville ton of useful input within within openmetrics.
00:13:49 [W] That's familiar. We mainly work by consensus in for that because so we tend to not have overrides or anything but we tend to have very long discussions about all the details and we had quite a few attendants
00:14:03 [W] The details and we had quite a few attendants from many different companies over time so over to you Brian, yeah.
00:14:12 [W] So in terms of the actual openmetrics standards itself, the good news is that it is largely the same as radius for Mash.
00:14:19 [W] There's been a few cleanups, you know warts removed and a small few new features. As Richard said we're trying to avoid the second syndrome or kitchen sink effect and try and keep things small and any additions are
00:14:30 [W] Small still and so so far like it's quite possible. If you are using the python client support official Prometheus python client that you've already been using openmetrics for a year and a half because the reference implementation is there and the
00:14:45 [W] - Beyond The Pike and client that the other clients at some point will transparent to migrate you to openmetrics Without You noticing the general idea being that in theory. Everything will just work.
00:14:57 [W] There are however breaking changes which are likely to affect you. The big one is that the convention for counters to end in on this or total is now mandatory.
00:15:13 [W] So if you are already following that convention, it will be a seamless change. If it isn't then when your client Library switched your metrics never going to change.
00:15:26 [W] So this is something to get ahead of if you can so for example, if you were to metric called CPU seconds, it would end up being called inside Prometheus sysdig.
00:15:28 [W] You seconds total once migrated true.
00:15:36 [W] The other thing is the time second stamps are now in seconds for consistency because we use seconds everywhere in for me to use but historically Prometheus for Mac users milliseconds for the actual time stamps.
00:15:45 [W] And so we just changed out for consistency.
00:15:51 [W] But the thing is that extremely there's a very few good use cases for exposing timestamps directly.
00:15:56 [W] So this is unlikely to actually affect anyone are these not too many people so I wouldn't worry about this.
00:16:01 [W] It's the total of the counters.
00:16:01 [W] That's the big thing you need to think about.
00:16:02 [W] There's also a whole pile of other things. Like there was two different types of escaping.
00:16:11 [W] There's now only one because waste tekton phrase these scrapes.
00:16:14 [W] For example talking of collaboration whatever companies that was a request from in flux data.
00:16:23 [W] It's got 64-bit integers units are now in there in first class created something I request coming from Google as dr.
00:16:30 [W] Ivor.
00:16:31 [W] I wish I owe some Corner cases and now Prometheus is Paul, but there's also considerations in there for pushes.
00:16:38 [W] pushes. Well, it's make sure it works for everyone and the text format is still there historically Prometheus also had a prodyna format. That's
00:16:45 [W] Went by the wayside basically would Prometheus 2, but has reintroduced it openmetrics as an optional thing.
00:16:52 [W] So what's new?
00:16:58 [W] Probably one of the big features is exemplars because as metrics are just one part of your model monitoring solution, you're also going to have logs and traces and the idea would exempt there is you can say hey I had just had this request
00:17:10 [W] Second in this particular histogram.
00:17:16 [W] Can I go and find out the my tracing system?
00:17:17 [W] So here were saying hey DF that particular Trace. I be took 219 milliseconds and you can go find - and this is already supported directly in cortex and tunnels and will likely be exported for me.
00:17:31 [W] itself at some point as well to access this data.
00:17:33 [W] So the current status in terms of the Prometheus project as I've mentioned the previous time python client is the reference implementation for openmetrics and uses the openmetrics data model internally go so far has just limited support because go
00:17:48 [W] Porch and needs to go plant wanted to support exemplars and Prometheus has since version 2.5 will negotiate openmetrics preferentially.
00:18:02 [W] And and in phony no more. Now first class features. These are conventions that came up over the years as different ways to represent basically strings and you can use these and and eating with all this stuff is all degrades gracefully.
00:18:14 [W] So even if you're using say info and enum and you end up not negotiating openmetrics, you'll still
00:18:19 [W] get them looking like gauges as they would when Prometheus today.
00:18:25 [W] So it's all nice and transparent as far as we can make it.
00:18:26 [W] Now, of course, we want to be an open standard.
00:18:34 [W] So other companies are also ingesting it so today I think pretty much old main metrics monitoring vendors both commercial and non-commercial support to Prometheus text format.
00:18:46 [W] There's already companies as well like datadog for example is able to ingest openmetrics. And in fact, they also contribute age are quite a few performance improvements to the official reference parser.
00:18:53 [W] And in addition opentelemetry is planning to support openmetrics as a first-class wire format and indeed and some of the discussions we've had with openmetrics and Prometheus generator helping to shape opentelemetry VR experience.
00:19:09 [W] In metrics monitoring vendors both commercial and non-commercial support you can read his text format. There's already companies as well like datadog for example is able to ingest openmetrics.
00:19:11 [W] And in fact, they also contribute age are quite a few performance improvements to the official reference parser.
00:19:11 [W] And in addition at opentelemetry is planning to support openmetrics as a first-class wire format and indeed and some of the discussions we've had with in openmetrics and Prometheus generally are helping to shape opentelemetry.
00:19:13 [W] Via our experience just wanting to watch out for because you know openmetrics has been the words been around for a while. Now if someone says openmetrics, there's a good chance.
00:19:19 [W] They actually mean the read his text format. And so there is some confusion there unfortunately, but here's a simple way to help spotters as I mentioned the total counter changes to maintain so here the first example you'll see there's an underscore total in the type line
00:19:33 [W] Words been around for a while. Now.
00:19:34 [W] If someone says openmetrics, there's a good chance. They actually mean the read his text format.
00:19:35 [W] And so there is some confusion there unfortunately, but here's a simple way to help swadesh as mentions the total counter changes to maintain so here the first example you'll see there's an underscore total in the type line and also on the actual
00:19:35 [W] Queries in openmetrics, you'll see it has a unit which to pick reason for match and there's a underscore total is not present.
00:19:47 [W] There's also an example of underscore created and it also have hashicorp F at the end. So we know that the Expedition wasn't just interrupted made transfer.
00:19:53 [W] And as you can see, we since 2008 in you've actually already able to speak openmetrics on it already or happened automatically in the background, but standardizing stuff is hard.
00:20:09 [W] So sometimes the implementation is a lot further than the standard.
00:20:12 [W] let's talk about that a little bit the text format and the protocol of specs are done obviously cuz else we we couldn't have implemented those or brown goodnotes implemented those in the python Library.
00:20:24 [W] Long-form Pros version is done and it's currently being virtuous and compressed but there's there's the same with an ipf that something isn't done when you called at anything anymore, but when you can't take anything away anymore, and I think that's also
00:20:39 [W] same so we started with roughly 52 pages of just pure spec Eight Pages of those or sixteen pages of those have already been compressed down to roughly half of this and we have 36
00:20:55 [W] So we'll just compressed more and more because else.
00:20:58 [W] Hey, it wouldn't go through ITF.
00:21:04 [W] Anyway, if we didn't compress it like a lot.
00:21:09 [W] We do have a test tube which is ready to use. It's based on the python client library and you can already use this for compliance testing to get ready for when this actually hits the road or it's too dark or whatever.
00:21:19 [W] You know what I mean?
00:21:21 [W] What are the next steps completing this internet draft actually submitted to the RFC the process within hopefully the obstacle Yugi
00:21:28 [W] You know ITF, we already established establish contact there is good for those active interest in adoption by the WG qualitative or Kumari who has been helping on the end of ITF.
00:21:43 [W] Obviously, we all support openmetrics in all the official client libraries. We have exemplary support still to go into Mainline premises. It's already in the branch.
00:21:53 [W] And downstream projects like for example in 3D bof chronosphere Griffon a low-key and such also should use may make use of all this new mayadata.
00:22:04 [W] So how can you transition to openmetrics?
00:22:17 [W] Well again for the counters we underscore total thing is is important and if you add this now and if you do properly now you actually control when you make the change so we highly suggest you do this and just for the record all the client library integration still
00:22:20 [W] Sometimes to hide still to go into Mainline premises.
00:22:21 [W] It's already in the branch and downstream projects. Like for example in 3D Beyond chronosphere grow fonder Loki in such also should use may make use of all this new mayadata.
00:22:22 [W] So how can you transition to openmetrics?
00:22:23 [W] Well again for the counters we underscore total thing is is important and if you add this now and if you do it properly now, you actually control when you make the change so we highly suggest you do this and chatbots.
00:22:24 [W] Just for the record all the client library integration still handle this automatically.
00:22:26 [W] So even if you call your counter underscore total, it will not be called underscore total underscore total that will all happen for you.
00:22:34 [W] Anyone who's who's currently emitting data as in being scraped and sure that you set it occurred content types. So a Prometheus can see if this is actually a openmetrics or the Prometheus exposure for World Series.
00:22:43 [W] Even if you call your counter underscore talking, it will not be called underscore total underscore total that will all happen for you. Anyone who's who's currently emitting data as in being scraped and sure that you set it occurred content types
00:22:45 [W] And for anyone who is writing scrapers or Injustice, please set your head as accordingly so you can negotiate either Prometheus or openmetrics as you need.
00:22:56 [W] Thanks a lot.
00:22:58 [W] And now we are open for questions.
00:22:59 [W] Hello.
00:23:04 [W] so
00:23:07 [W] so I'm not one question so far and we have one.
00:23:16 [W] quick one
00:23:22 [W] Okay, just steal a will actually leave me.
00:23:28 [W] Now I can't hear you.
00:23:36 [W] Okay.
00:23:38 [W] Sorry y'all.
00:23:39 [W] Yeah.
00:23:45 [W] Yeah, we we have to all your lines and it's kind of confusing.
00:23:48 [W] So I'll just go continue in the next question goes to ground.
00:23:50 [W] Then we have less confused. Anyway, the question was intersection of opentracing and openmetrics opentracing and open senses.
00:24:02 [W] And there's a lot of open in here joined into opentelemetry and that basically also he made soft words. That's horrible.
00:24:08 [W] So there's better so
00:24:10 [W] This is horrible with the topic. Okay this better.
00:24:22 [W] Okay, sorry.
00:24:30 [W] So again opentracing and open senses Joint Forces into opentelemetry and they have a very wide Focus which which basically goes Way Beyond just tracing a just metrics.
00:24:41 [W] It also covers logs to covers errors.
00:24:44 [W] It covers tracing and covers all the things.
00:24:46 [W] This is largely unrelated from openmetrics, which is meaning to adjust cover metrics with the updates thing about exemplars and
00:24:55 [W] Tracing and opentelemetry is planning to have openmetrics as a first class citizen.
00:25:07 [W] So being able to expose data which is compatible with open metrics through the opentelemetry libraries same as through the Prometheus libraries.
00:25:14 [W] And yes, there's a lots of opening you.
00:25:17 [W] The next question also has the word open as a uses the word openmetrics.
00:25:24 [W] So it Denis Denis asks does openmetrics support pushing metrics to the answer is yes.
00:25:37 [W] So for openmetrics, it is primarily a for Mash so there's no restrictions. But if you're going to implement it you basically have to provide pull over HTTP, but you're also fully free to push it any way you like as well.
00:25:45 [W] the Prometheus lovers
00:25:45 [W] and yes, there's a lot of open in you.
00:25:45 [W] The next question also has the word open as a uses the word openmetrics.
00:25:46 [W] So the knees Dennis asks does openmetrics support pushing metrics to the answer is yes.
00:25:47 [W] So for openmetrics, it is primarily a for Mash so there's no restrictions. But if you're going to implement it you basically have provide pull over HTTP, but you're also fully free to push.
00:25:49 [W] it any way you like as well. So the idea is that everyone knows they can always
00:25:51 [W] But pushes always an option if you want to implement that.
00:25:52 [W] They seem to be about all the questions we have silver. We had a question as well about the slides like it should be up on the Yukon website at some point.
00:26:06 [W] But Richie is also linked it in slack in Cube call maintainer in the tread there if people want to get to more quickly.
00:26:11 [W] And also been one you can maybe just open an issue on the openmetrics openmetrics data board. That is probably best.
00:26:32 [W] Yes question from Christopher asking. Is there a timeline for when exemplars are available in Prometheus?
00:26:41 [W] There is a pull request open the zoo add some support.
00:26:44 [W] there was some movement Amish inside the last week. The thing is that they're fundamentally Prometheus.
00:26:46 [W] Metric space system so exempt ourselves likely to be limited because in terms of performance and traces exemplars are look like logs and they're completely different performance profile, but will be of these some Basics anyway, like the big
00:27:01 [W] Sir, completely different performance profile but will be of these some Basics anyway, like the big thing is being able to link from you know, what's happening right now and being able to link that into your tracing system rather than Prometheus ending up as a full example are tracing system itself.
00:27:11 [W] Give it another fit and kisses any more questions.
00:27:26 [W] Your view think use and the well received.
00:27:37 [W] Thank you back.
00:27:39 [W] Jones takes a question from Jose
00:27:41 [W] Oh, yeah, just let me unplug course else.
00:27:54 [W] My brain gets confused by Hugh myself with huge deal a the we have tried onboarding people in the past and even after they just left for a few months and we joined all the context was
00:28:07 [W] Oh, yeah, just let me unplug course else. My brain gets confused by Hugh myself with huge deal a the we have tried onboarding people in the past and even after they just left for
00:28:08 [W] Dinner was impossible to unbolt them course.
00:28:12 [W] The thing is we don't we didn't really have much oil we didn't have it written down in a form which allows someone who doesn't have all that mental context to have a fighting chance to actually figure out the current state.
00:28:25 [W] So we decided to live deliberately to not onboard anyone else until that Wonder dough is finished cars basically the work of writing out the window and the work of enabling people to be
00:28:39 [W] on boarded is roughly the same and the work is roughly the same. So what you can absolutely do is you can you can look at the python implementation and just see how that looks. We will also
00:28:52 [W] Timber be publishing the the actual draft which is going into ITF.
00:29:05 [W] But before that point in time, it's just like for human on scalability issues not possible, which isn't your entire would life.
00:29:11 [W] I would like to be giving but that's the honest answer one of the examples things why it's difficult to onboard people is that if someone uses the word metadata, they could mean five different things and would take half an hour an hour of a meeting just to determine which of those
00:29:26 [W] They were talking about and how revealing which has so like once we have the spec out it will hopefully make - are much easier to deal with because we've actually said okay, here's the five things moving point were directly.
00:29:35 [W] I think you just answered Tim basically there.
00:29:39 [W] Yes.
00:29:44 [W] Okay. So question from William asking openmetrics designed to replace the Expedition format, assuming the treaty six additional - I think long term. Yes, that would be the idea.
00:30:03 [W] There is a completely different question of at what point does Prometheus stopping able to ingest the old for MASH which like the last time we discussed it which was quite some time ago within Prometheus. The answer was that's a long way off.
00:30:13 [W] At least not immediately.
00:30:25 [W] So and also just to add more context where when this was started either late 2015 or early 2016.
00:30:45 [W] There was actually a consensus within Prometheus team or what was done for me to steam or whatever.
00:30:47 [W] It doesn't matter that this would be replacement long term, but there is no timeline or anything its branches, but basically just the intention before we started with all of this. Bye.
00:31:00 [W] Rich's team was that yes, this will be the new thing course. The other thing was just growing out of neat organically and there was this chance to redo it a little bit more cleanly if maybe know what none of us thought it would take so long, but
00:31:13 [W] Yeah, I like the main breaking change to discuss isn't so much at what point does the old format go away.
00:31:28 [W] But at what point if you just randomly visit and exporter in your browser, does it give you openmetrics router and Prometheus now Prometheus does called negotiations.
00:31:32 [W] So that's all fine for us.
00:31:40 [W] But at some point that will flip and so make sure as you mentioned the told that you're doing called Indigo she action if you're scraping either formats just to make sure you get the one you want.
00:31:42 [W] Question from Alex you have any links where I can read more about how to use exemplars.
00:31:59 [W] So in the context of openmetrics ters currently support in the pipe and climbs so you can look at the dock strings there and also the go blind supports exemplars.
00:32:05 [W] And so you can also read the documentation for the gold client.
00:32:06 [W] Just how to use those note.
00:32:10 [W] There's an extra Fields you need to specify an expedition to say.
00:32:12 [W] Yes, you do want to have openmetrics as an option and but yeah, maybe
00:32:14 [W] read the client libraries currently and as it stands I will just expose the information like Prometheus doesn't do anything with it right now, but other systems can
00:32:24 [W] The go blind supports exemplars. And so you can also read the documentation for the gold client.
00:32:44 [W] Just how to use those note.
00:32:44 [W] There's an extra Fields. You need to specify next addition to say.
00:32:45 [W] Yes, you do want to have openmetrics as an option and but yeah basically read the client libraries currently and as it stands that will just expose the information like Prometheus doesn't do anything with it right now, but other systems can
00:32:46 [W] You know those the question about about contributing again, basically once we publish this on the on the obstacle Yugi mailing list, that's that's the best time to get started.
00:32:49 [W] But again before that you can just start looking at the python client or would you could also be doing is you could just be scrutinized scraping something which is written with the python client library and just look at what's on the wire because
00:32:59 [W] Started but again before that you can just start looking at the python client or would you could also be doing is you could just be scrutinized scraping something which is written with the python client library and just look at what's on the wire.
00:33:01 [W] At openmetrics, but there's obviously no way to start contributing and shaming shaping.
00:33:07 [W] That's for our idea.
00:33:09 [W] idea. Yeah. Well, so we're only to get the other client libraries like the Java client will need is implemented as well as the Ruby client.
00:33:16 [W] plus, of course holding certain hardly to the station
00:33:25 [W] Yeah, I like how is because it's back isn't out.
00:33:32 [W] But if you want to like see see me on GitHub to just verified implementation is correct. I'll be happy to do that.
00:33:34 [W] People's now's your time to shine and ask more questions.
00:33:52 [W] Okay doesn't look like there's any more questions you want to wrap up Archie.
00:34:21 [W] I think so.
00:34:30 [W] Let's let's give everyone one more minute.
00:34:31 [W] So if you want to ask anything now's the time to trust right anything or dot or whatever so we know it's coming.
00:34:44 [W] Okay, then I think we can actually wrap and we'll be popping. The engineering questions came in.
00:35:17 [W] That one's definitely for you.
00:35:18 [W] Loop
00:35:22 [W] so there isn't too much in the open source space which which goes YX employers as of right now, but as s basically the protocols and standards and the wire
00:35:39 [W] Thinking of how to expose traces is getting there.
00:35:50 [W] It's more or less a question of time until there is more in the open-source ecosystem around following traces through through exemplars as opposed to searching for them through various mechanisms.
00:35:58 [W] Yeah, I think the closest is no key fine ravana who she works for and that they just do metrics and logs. So hopefully we'll see more at racing stuff in future as well.
00:36:10 [W] and just someone asking about the slides and once again, they're in snack in the to coupon maintainer saying I'll give you the link to your question,
00:36:30 [W] and just someone asking about the slides and once again, they're in snack in the to coupon maintainer saying I'll give you the link to your question,
00:36:32 [W] She's already shared them to lock the door.
00:36:33 [W] Yes.
00:36:37 [W] There's also more stuff in in my GitHub repository which you can just navigate through a very can also find a few other slide decks just search for openmetrics and you'll find them
00:36:53 [W] question for me, so
00:36:59 [W] Postion.
00:37:01 [W] I'm sorry.
00:37:02 [W] I'm not sure how to pronounce - we've been using drop position or Java microservices. Would you suggest switching to the Prometheus Java client instead?
00:37:11 [W] So drop Wizard and is a pretty popular and Library overall and it's metrics as well are used in places Beyond where did General job wizard HTTP framework were used and the main thing about drop wizard.
00:37:24 [W] It doesn't support labels like Prometheus does and so it's generally I personally as the maintainer of the Prometheus Java type would encourage you
00:37:29 [W] He is the freakiest Java client instead. The other thing is that a lot of drop lizard is Will pre computing's like quantiles and rates and so on.
00:37:44 [W] So it's not at all as resilient as meteors text format is which does calculations on the Prometheus side. Generally, I would recommend using the previous Java client because depending on what features you using it can be quite a bit faster overall.
00:37:55 [W] and depending on exactly which features of the said certain features and drop it exactly as fast or faster than previous, but you're in general I'd recommend using official client libraries if you're using Prometheus where you can
00:38:07 [W] Of course, it's not for me case for match is de facto an open standard as is openmetrics. So you're free to use whatever you like. But if you want to get the full power of all the labels and so on it's best to use something with full support for it.
00:38:20 [W] Power of all the labels and so on its best easily with full support for it.
00:38:24 [W] You know, so I mean we still have time and you have Prometheus team members here.
00:38:34 [W] if you want to you you're also free to ask more general questions if you want to I mean, we also have this this open Booth thing but yet like we are here and we booked the time so
00:38:49 [W] Question for Michael Gross. So yep. So and also maybe we should start repeating questions cause I don't actually know how those are exposed in the UI.
00:39:36 [W] Question for Michael Gross. So yep. So and also maybe we should start repeating the questions cause I don't actually know how those are exposed in the UI.
00:39:39 [W] What do we mean when we say x employers with respect to the traces?
00:39:44 [W] Basically, what what you can do with how you don't have a way to show you the Curt flood but it doesn't matter you have your you have your line where you say my metric name, my my value maybe has a time stamp.
00:39:56 [W] On the inside something and that something designates a traitor.
00:40:08 [W] He and Exemplar is basically the concept of not having something to to to search for your trees. Like I know name of the clustering name of the customer name of the whatever and and look through through an
00:40:18 [W] Search for your trees, like I know name of the cluster your name of the customer name of the whatever and look through through an index and then search for that thing instead.
00:40:23 [W] You just have an ID 123 a b and that's the that's the name.
00:40:28 [W] That's the identity of your traits.
00:40:29 [W] what you do within within openmetrics, you have a bucket where you have a certain latency, whatever and you just attach a 1 2 3 a b to that one line and now the
00:40:40 [W] The system would ingest this data knows there is a trace an existing in existence which fell into this bucket and which you can look at if you want to for example discern by took so long why it was a quick or white habit property does matter and
00:40:54 [W] Directly from your metrics into your tracing system without having to search for anything. You literally just look it up by ID.
00:41:07 [W] And obviously that's a lot quicker.
00:41:11 [W] Of course, you don't have to do you like I mean, it's still searching.
00:41:14 [W] It's still an index look up with in tracing system, but it's not a full search anymore.
00:41:18 [W] It's just like literally look at that one index and jump to the thing and that's a lot quicker and it also matches how you usually tend to work with traces because usually
00:41:27 [W] you're coming from a log line or a metric and jump into the trees to look at that one specific traits as opposed to just looking at all your traces after a random arbitrary searches, like usually you would be interested in the
00:41:40 [W] you have that thing which loans the transfer agents already and that's that's basically
00:41:48 [W] Okay, I will go first Stewart asks as same question for but firm my creature should we use the official media is Java client?
00:42:06 [W] So micrometer is last time I checked anyway, it's been about a year is a fake aid over a few different instrumentation systems.
00:42:11 [W] So it does have labels so has the key features for ideas - and lots of people do seem happy to use my my Creator and so it is definitely an option if you're using Java.
00:42:23 [W] Personally, of course as the maintainer of the of the Prometheus Java client will encourage you to do is bring this Java client, but it's not a bad idea to use it like lots of people seem pretty happy to use it if there is still some impedance mismatch between the radius and does
00:42:37 [W] Because it's kind of following in some ways the drop is our bottle and but you know, it's certainly an option from in Java land.
00:42:46 [W] So the next question is by sorry if I get to rename room would Shake.
00:42:59 [W] Coochie-coo!
00:43:04 [W] Okay. Sorry, I can't pronounce the name.
00:43:10 [W] The question is how to how a complete newbie in as Rican started. It can get started with Prometheus. There's there's at least two possible answers one is just do it like either grab grab
00:43:19 [W] Included in whatever language you you're using and just start exposing some data and getting used to this.
00:43:29 [W] There's also a pretty good book Prometheus up and running written by Brian which which I can highly recommend and for the other thing I'd like the third answer.
00:43:41 [W] I'll link this into your into your reply. I did a talk social aspects of change years ago, which is basically about how to how to get an
00:43:49 [W] Ization to adapt Prometheus when they're not used to running in this model and I mean SRE is a lot more in just running Prometheus like it is mainly to me at least about a having proper monitoring visibility
00:44:04 [W] Burr of your system and actually having a cell is as an OS L a--'s like service level indicator service level objectives and service level agreements the indicators of what you measure the objectives of what you have to hit and the Agreements are
00:44:20 [W] we have to pay someone course course you feel the contract and that you only alert on user visible stuff or imminently user visible and the rest is basically signals, which help you debug but not something to wake someone 3:00 in the morning,
00:44:36 [W] There's a lot of organizational or cultural change very a Embrace change and basically except that it's something which which just happens and which you need to anticipate there are no holy calls. You just have to be able to change and and
00:44:52 [W] P and aligning the incentives between developers and operators like for example, if you have an error budget and the developers can all of a sudden choose to they want to have more features, but then
00:45:07 [W] Software or do they want to burn the our budget on unstable software, but then they can't do as much a/b testing or what have you and this is aligned with the incentive of the operator of making sure that that the software doesn't go down and there's a lot of
00:45:23 [W] There is two more books by Riley chasing a sari and the asari handle. I think also both by Riley which I can only highly recommend reading and also again, I'll link you those slides.
00:45:39 [W] So there's a question from David here asking how do you deal with high quality in metrics given tracing IDs?
00:45:51 [W] And so the thing is that so high card Martin generally is that the limitation of metrics is how many metres
00:45:55 [W] Rex you have how many time series you have?
00:45:56 [W] And so if you were to put Tre sizes in there, which are basically random IDs that would kill pretty much any MX based monitoring system.
00:46:08 [W] So one of the only one of the things we have to discuss was how do we deal with this?
00:46:11 [W] these are not just normal labels like in previous and because like meteors can deal with customers like a hundred million they've managed to put in for Medias.
00:46:19 [W] So what we have is that it's basically a comment on the side. So if you can just ignore them and you'll have two special cases, you just ignore everything after a hash sign because all of the other principles as well is that this format needs to work for things that aren't Prometheus and
00:46:35 [W] UPS have any notion of counters or gauges or anything and make sure that they can still deal with this format in the still meaningful to them that even if they aren't Prometheus was like Prometheus right now doesn't do anything really or nothing semantically
00:46:51 [W] Where's all the other metadata? So there's a way that we can have this information for systems that use it without killing performance-wise systems to can't deal with it.
00:47:02 [W] So basically it's just not ingested by for me to the normal way.
00:47:06 [W] Okay, I think we should about wrapped up there Carlos if you want to ask your question in the tread there or in the
00:47:15 [W] The Pavilion meet up we have later
00:47:17 [W] Do you have any final words to say Richie?
00:47:20 [W] Thanks for attending this is viewed for all of us. But I think we're slowly getting the hang of how to how to do online conferences in a not absolutely horrible way. Also thanks to to the engineers in the background who actually keep the side running.
00:47:42 [W] And who are invited to just say hi and enjoy a round of virtual Applause?
00:47:48 [W] And for the rest there is this too - que con - containerd channel on cncf slag, which has a subvert which is about this stock.
00:48:04 [W] So just jump in there if you if you want to if you want to talk more
00:48:08 [W] Have more questions whatever is to just finally closed. We like Carlos questions about importing historical data.
00:48:24 [W] I will also link this in here or in this like we had a deaf Summit where we agreed that we will have historical import of data, but
00:48:29 [W] Hey, your audio is gone Richie.
00:48:36 [W] Okay, well as thanks very much everyone and we'll finish our sisters have your back.
00:48:44 [W] Okay, nothing. I'll take it just like
