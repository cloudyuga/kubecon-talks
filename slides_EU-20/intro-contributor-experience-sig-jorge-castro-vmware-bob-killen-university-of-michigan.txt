00:07:50 [W] Welcome to contribute Erick.
00:08:01 [W] Welcome to contributor experience.
00:13:46 [W] Welcome to contributor experience.
00:13:52 [W] We are one of the 23 special interest groups in kubernative.
00:13:52 [W] He's in this talk.
00:13:52 [W] We're going to go over who we are what we do and how we do it.
00:13:57 [W] I'm George Castro a community manager VMware and I'm Bob Killin a research clotted minister at the University of Michigan before we get started the kubernative community is massive. We have over 48,000 drive-by contributors.
00:14:05 [W] I'm George Castro a community manager VMware and I'm Bob Killin a research clotted minister at the University of Michigan before we get started the kubernative community is massive. We have over 48,000 drive-by contributors.
00:14:07 [W] Mitad issues or PRS or fixes to kubernative and out of those we have about almost 1200 org members which we consider to be for developers who are larger contributors to the project we manage about 209.
00:14:23 [W] To GitHub and have process almost a hundred and sixty seven thousand pull requests and have a healthy community of 100,000 users in our slack.
00:14:36 [W] That should give you an understanding of who we are kubernative is is divided into 23 cigs 11 working groups three committees and to user groups.
00:14:46 [W] We're diverse Sig with a lot of different people with different backgrounds work at different companies and different interests. We tend to be the meta Sig for the project if you consider kubernative,
00:14:54 [W] he's as a large network of interconnected groups.
00:14:58 [W] We tend to be the Grand Central Station where cigs can collaborate around making things better for themselves and for new contributors.
00:15:08 [W] If you have no idea where to contribute then we'd be honored to be your first Sig.
00:15:15 [W] It's not uncommon for people to hang out with us while they understand and figure out how the project works and then move on to whatever specialized Sig interests them more remember kubernative is an operating system people.
00:15:22 [W] Love to play with networking for a while. They want to learn how storageos
00:15:24 [W] Works and they may be dip their toes in the apis.
00:15:31 [W] There's no wrong way to do it and there's never a shortage of work in any area of kubernative.
00:15:32 [W] He's so for us finding a place for you makes us happy.
00:15:39 [W] So you've met myself in Bob Sig's have co-chairs and tech leads who are facilitators of the Sig our job is to keep the ball rolling and ensuring people are empowered to fulfill to do the things that they want to do.
00:15:50 [W] They want to learn how storage works and they may be dipped their toes in the apis.
00:15:54 [W] There's no wrong way to do it and there's never a shortage of work in any area of kubernative.
00:15:54 [W] So for us finding a place for you makes us happy. So you've met myself in Bob Sig's have co-chairs and tech leads who are facilitators of the Sig our job is to keep the ball rolling and ensuring people are empowered to fulfill
00:15:56 [W] We've been selected to represent the Sig as your chairs and tech leads.
00:15:59 [W] We follow in the footsteps of the great leaders of the past like Paris Pittman. I'll see Phillips and Garrett Rodriguez.
00:16:04 [W] Let's talk about teams kubernative his huge dividing and conquering is really the only reasonable way to accomplish a large amount of work at the same time.
00:16:20 [W] So we tend to be divided into teams and sub projects, which we'll get to in a little bit our teams are we have an events team? We have a marketing team.
00:16:24 [W] We have a GitHub Administration team.
00:16:35 [W] We have a stream team which handles our YouTube work. We have a team of moderators and an entire team of people who handle the Asia Pacific time zone and
00:16:36 [W] Community managers which is our team. That is basically if you're not in a team you're in the community manager team, and that's just what we call ourselves.
00:16:44 [W] So what do we do?
00:16:49 [W] you might have seen our work during your first pull request to kubernative any given time we have a thousand or so open pull requests.
00:16:58 [W] So we depend on automation to help put those PRS in front of the right eye balls doing that requires assembling processes for us to follow on how to do exactly that that's just one example of a process that we work on.
00:17:08 [W] We usually have one of these processes for every part of the contribution process things. Like when should we expire abandoned GitHub issues to what's the
00:17:15 [W] Storage, for example, so we strive to get contributors consistent experience across the project while at the same time providing services to these other cigs to make their lives easier.
00:17:41 [W] So first things first, we have a nice large list for you of every Sig here at this link this lists the Sig the co-chair their slack Channel their mailing list and more importantly their meetings and they're meeting notes
00:17:53 [W] These are public and have a public notes document.
00:17:59 [W] This is a great way to browse on what you want to do.
00:18:06 [W] So if you start at this page click around see what interests you and then you can dig a little bit deeper into each one of these cigs.
00:18:12 [W] We also publish a community calendar which has all of those Sig meetings that other project meetings in one place.
00:18:17 [W] We recommend to subscribing to the calendar so that you can see what's going on in the community. Also if you subscribe to that cigs mailing list, you will automatically get a meeting invite to that Sig
00:18:24 [W] eggs public meeting note that we're working on a contributor site.
00:18:32 [W] So these URLs will become much more friendlier and easier to remember and we'll talk about that in a few minutes.
00:18:33 [W] How we doing this via sub-projects?
00:18:44 [W] So what we do is we take everything that the Sig bones and then we divide it into conquerable areas that we apply a team to a sub-project.
00:18:47 [W] We're going to talk about the community sub-project.
00:18:51 [W] We kind of owns and manages the overall Community repo. We will talk about the Community Management sub-project which manages the operations and policy for a lot of the things that we do here contributor documentation is the home for things or contributor and developer guides and
00:19:02 [W] we will be covering deaf stats, which is our set of Griffon our dashboards that tries to gather all the metrics around contribution so we can figure out things like PR velocity average mean time between a PR and merge and we can figure out
00:19:18 [W] Things like PR velocity average mean time between a PR and merge and we can figure out who's contributing where and that gives us the data and information that we need to make better policy decisions and to figure out where we can improve as a project.
00:19:27 [W] Events, so these mostly our physical events.
00:19:36 [W] Some of you might have attended a contributor Summit.
00:19:37 [W] We will be talking about events and their effects going forward especially in this calendar year. We have an entire sub project dedicated to GitHub management.
00:19:51 [W] So the kubernative code base does all live on GitHub and there's an entire sub-project who manages that and Bob will be getting into those details Kate's dot IO is our home page and it's the home of the kubernative.
00:19:59 [W] For structure working group in this video playlist, there should be a status and we will briefly talk about some of the things that we do their mentoring. Of course as a huge project the best way to get things done is
00:20:13 [W] Either group mentorship or want to One Mentor s***.
00:20:20 [W] There's no guide or anything that we can write that's better than people helping themselves out to understand and figure out how things work.
00:20:26 [W] So we have an entire sub-project to that.
00:20:31 [W] We will be dedicating some time to tell you how that works.
00:20:38 [W] And then lastly keeping a slack infrastructure healthy is difficult, especially with such a large group. So we're going to cover some of the tools and policies that we've put in place to make that fun.
00:20:47 [W] So First Community Management mailing lists and calendars fall under this all of our mailing list are hosted on Google Groups. And as I've been mentioning all these things have a public mailing list and meetings.
00:21:00 [W] It's not uncommon for cigs to publish their meeting notes regularly on their mailing list It's usually the first place where you want to ask a question or interact with members of the community.
00:21:11 [W] So we host these as a project in one place for us as sick attributor experience weaveworks.
00:21:14 [W] You maintain these and kind of do the infrastructure Plumbing background. So hopefully your interaction with mailing list is just as a user and we've currently made some progress in these areas to make this less painful and easier to manage for those of you that are
00:21:29 [W] Dealing with so all you really need to do is join the mailing list and figure out how to organize the mail and whatever email service you use YouTube youtube.com slash kubernative Community is the home to all of our YouTube videos.
00:21:45 [W] Not only will you find all the Sig meeting Zoom recordings in there, but you will also find some top level meetings that we do host in there.
00:21:53 [W] So, for example, we have a monthly community meeting that covers all aspects of the project. We have instructional videos. We have code walkthroughs of certain
00:22:00 [W] Areas of the code base the release team after every release doesn't entire post mortem of the release process that gets recorded and put in there.
00:22:14 [W] So if you subscribe to this, you will be getting weekly updates of things that are happening all over the kubernetes community and it's an excellent resource.
00:22:21 [W] If you want to catch up on the long tail of things like that.
00:22:27 [W] This sub project is managed by the stream team and we're always looking for more members. We do have these meetings and sometimes we have special events and things
00:22:30 [W] Fat and those are recorded and put on YouTube and that's done by a set of volunteers.
00:22:39 [W] So we try to as a global project to cover all sorts of time zones.
00:22:50 [W] So when we do have live streaming events that cover for example Europe and the east coast of the us, we'd love to bring that kind of content also to people who live in the West Coast or Asia Pacific.
00:22:54 [W] You can always use skills like that. So please let us know if you're interested in something like that.
00:23:06 [W] The Community Management sub-project one of its main task is owning stuff github.com kubernative / kubernative is where kubernative the software itself lives github.com such kubernative / Community
00:23:22 [W] Ready repo here.
00:23:25 [W] You will find things like our governance documentation election procedures our values our code of conduct and any kind of the projects that are happening around the project tend to live in the community repo and that is owned by
00:23:39 [W] Jacked Zoom.
00:23:47 [W] There's a lot of things that this sig does for Zoom as far as managing the licenses that we need so that Sig chairs can run their meetings and record them and all sorts of stuff as an end-user contributor.
00:23:55 [W] You generally don't need to deal with any of this.
00:23:58 [W] But if you do know how to administer these tools, like I said, we always could use some help. However, you can help us out by ensuring that the zoom client on your computer's up-to-date. They are constantly adding new features, especially around moderation that we are always using and consuming and
00:24:13 [W] it never hurts to keep up with their security updates.
00:24:15 [W] So keep your clients up-to-date discuss that kubernative dot. IO is our discourse powered Community forums.
00:24:24 [W] It's a more user web friendly way to have discussions if you're not interested in developer mailing list, so we kind of run this for our end users.
00:24:31 [W] You will find developers there.
00:24:35 [W] You will find people who might have the same interests the same questions and it's just a nice long.
00:24:38 [W] Huge Forum full of information everything from Cube cuddle tips and tricks to hey everybody check out this cool post that I saw about kubernative.
00:24:50 [W] So it's a great way to spin up on kubernative information moderators each of these tools and properties that we use whether that Zoom YouTube slack discourse all need moderators.
00:25:03 [W] We do have a code of conduct that needs to be enforced. We do expect when someone comes to one of our properties that they will have a wonderful friendly.
00:25:08 [W] The same questions and it's just a nice long huge Forum full of information everything from Cube Cottle tips and tricks to hey everybody check out this cool post that I saw about kubernative.
00:25:11 [W] So it's a great way to spin up on kubernative information moderators each of these tools and properties that we use whether that's Zoom YouTube slack discourse all need moderators.
00:25:12 [W] We do have a code of conduct that needs to be enforced we do expect.
00:25:13 [W] Twen someone comes to one of our properties that they will have a wonderful friendly user experience and for that we depend on a large group of moderators across almost every time zone in the world to make sure that we're just keeping things nice and clean.
00:25:19 [W] We are always looking for Mom or moderators, especially if you're in the Asia Pacific time zone to help give us that Global coverage that we need.
00:25:27 [W] Upstream marketing used to be part of Community Management.
00:25:35 [W] However, thanks to people like Matt Bro Berg.
00:25:41 [W] This is a great example of a project that started out small and has now is well on its way of becoming its own sub-project. This project was initially started by Paris Pittman and then is is an example on how we have projects off to people as they on boardd into kubenetes
00:25:50 [W] Be part of Community Management.
00:25:51 [W] However, thanks to people like Matt Bro Berg.
00:25:51 [W] This is a great example of a project that started out small and as now is well on its way of becoming its own sub-project.
00:25:52 [W] This project was initially started by Paris Pittman and then it is is an example on how we have projects off to people as they on boardd into kubernative and tell us what they're interested in and then just find something that they're passionate about and then just take it over. So this team was established
00:25:57 [W] They set up an entire communication framework.
00:26:02 [W] We've got a new Twitter account that will just have information and used specifically for contributors to allow us to give users more information in a place that's consistent so they can find out what's going on and not depend on
00:26:15 [W] All the time to figure out what's going on in the project.
00:26:20 [W] There's plenty of things to do here in this team.
00:26:25 [W] And before I hand it off to Bob just a reminder a lot of these teams that you see the people that are volunteering and working here. You do not need to be a developer or a programmer.
00:26:39 [W] We always need project management help any kind of social experience you might have and just, you know be passionate about something there's always things that we need help with and if we can't find a thing
00:26:46 [W] that you can help us out will always work to find a place for you. And with that we'll move on to documentation.
00:26:54 [W] It's my turn to take over.
00:27:04 [W] So I want to Dive Right into our documentation this sort of a living set of documents. And with that it's sort of like is broken down into two broad areas the contributor guide. This is something everyone should be familiar with whether you are
00:27:09 [W] Action running issued Tree on sessions are more.
00:27:18 [W] It's sort of the base level of knowledge to be of effective in our community.
00:27:24 [W] Next is the developer guide this focus more specifically on developing kubernative things like going best practices how to write tests API best practices and much more.
00:27:33 [W] more. This is currently also going undergoing a significant rework with the help of Joel Barker and Eric Aronson to Tech writers that are helping us sort of with our information.
00:27:40 [W] Texture and sort of restructuring documentation to be much more helpful.
00:27:45 [W] Sorry on both of these things.
00:27:48 [W] We're always also looking for more help with revising them, especially new contributors who can approach them with sort of The Beginner's mind.
00:27:57 [W] There's always details that we as more experienced computers overlooked and these little things will help many others going forward lastly.
00:28:05 [W] We have our contributor site this we really want to publish soon. Hopefully by the time this is actually
00:28:10 [W] The site will be live.
00:28:18 [W] But the the sort of the idea behind it is that the our documentation in GitHub is not very discoverable and having a single website.
00:28:23 [W] You could go to for things like the computer guy the developer guide our calendar and some other resources would be extremely valuable and as well as helping with our general information discoverability problems.
00:28:32 [W] I'm both of these things.
00:28:40 [W] We're always also looking for more help with revising them.
00:28:40 [W] Especially new contributors who can approach them with sort of The Beginner's mind.
00:28:40 [W] There's always details that we as more experienced computers overlooked and these little things will help many others going forward lastly.
00:28:41 [W] We have our contributor site this we really want to publish soon.
00:28:42 [W] Hopefully by the time this is actually live the site will be live, but the the sort of the idea behind it. Is that the our document
00:28:43 [W] Station in GitHub is not very discoverable and having a single website.
00:28:45 [W] you could go to for things like the computer guy the developer guide our calendar and some other resources would be extremely valuable and as well as helping with our general information discoverability problems.
00:28:48 [W] The next project or sub-project is Dev stats as George mentioned earlier this sort of a tool to help visualize our GitHub activity.
00:28:52 [W] It uses the GitHub archives to sort of crunch a bunch of data and calculate various things on GitHub events.
00:28:53 [W] And this can give us things like PR velocity how many and who liked who is contributing?
00:28:57 [W] It's where we get some of our numbers for the first slide that we had in this deck. So like the number of contributors now historically it has been actually
00:29:04 [W] super useful for our community groups like our cigs and working groups, but one of our contributors Lori Apple has been spearheading an effort to build some better dashboards that we can use especially when it comes to trying to find some like good Community Health metrics and if sifting through

00:29:19 [W] So like the number of contributors now historically it has been actually super useful for our community groups like our cigs and working groups, but one of our contributors Lori Apple has been spearheading an effort to build some better dashboards.
00:29:23 [W] That we can use especially when it comes to trying to find some like good Community Health metrics and if sifting through data is your thing. This might be this might be of interest and if you're interested, please feel free to reach out and Slack.
00:29:27 [W] Next is events now events have been hit hard this year.
00:29:32 [W] We regularly hosts Three contributes.
00:29:35 [W] Could you bring some it's a year alongside coupon and each one has its own event team sort of modeled off are really steamed with their Shadow program.
00:29:46 [W] It's been one of our more successful successful means we've had for onboarding new contributors.
00:29:52 [W] These events are always a great opportunity for contributors to get like FaceTime with each other.
00:29:54 [W] We also have social activities. There's lots of
00:29:56 [W] Content to help contributors sort of level up with regard to things like writing tests hunting flakes or how to write a better API.
00:30:09 [W] We might wind up doing a virtual event for can kind with America later this year, but it's still sort of to be determined.
00:30:17 [W] you are interested in that sort of thing, please subscribe to the Coon is Dev mailing list and all Communications regarding that will be silent that the other big thing that our events team handles is the elections for our steering committee so our steering committee.
00:30:27 [W] It's happen once a year and members are appointed to the steering committee are elected for a two-year term and these sort of sort of set the policy for some of the project in well joint steer it and then we as contributor experience are sort of the
00:30:39 [W] Questions regarding that will be silent that the other big thing that our events team handles is the elections for our steering committee. So our steering committee elections happen once a year and members that are pointed to the steering committee are elected for a two-year term.
00:30:41 [W] the policy
00:30:41 [W] the next project is sort of near and dear to my heart. And that is GitHub management this sub-project along with the GitHub admin team managed how contributors interact with GitHub along with like, you know becoming an orc member as well as a creating and managing repose.
00:30:59 [W] Ders interact with GitHub along with like, you know becoming an org member as well as like creating and managing Repose and some of the more recent stuff we've been working on has been sort of Designing finding the the member lifecycle policy.
00:31:07 [W] So the project is now 6 years old and people are not expected to be contributing to it forever.
00:31:18 [W] But with org membership comes an elevated permissions and be able to use our CI without checks as well as like potentially sign off on code. So we need to think about like off-boarding as well.
00:31:25 [W] One of the other initiatives under the GitHub management project has been to retire one of our older orgs kubenetes incubator.
00:31:33 [W] It was an idea several years ago to try out some like tried some things in the decide. If a project should be accepted in the project or for should be spun back out on its own and this process had a whole slew of issues and sort of being released released replaced by a different process and
00:31:47 [W] This recording there are just two repos left and the final decisions on those either being brought into the org or being spun out should be reached by the end of July making the changes hopefully going in place in August.
00:32:03 [W] Be reached by the end of July making the changes hopefully going in place in August lastly. We have an upcoming initiative and that's to begin to prune some of our Repose that have gone in active.
00:32:11 [W] We have 209 Repose and with this project being, you know, six years old.
00:32:20 [W] There are some that were like sort of experiments and other ideas that aren't really actively being maintained on anymore and it just makes sense for them to be archived and and this is sort of like, it seems like a lot of janitorial work, but it's essential to the project.
00:32:30 [W] But none the less now before I jump right into our next subproject mentoring. There is a little bit of a prerequisite.
00:32:36 [W] I wanted to just sort of get out of the way.
00:32:45 [W] So this is known as the letter and I want to credit the slide to one of our contributors one of your singer who came with the original version of this and it sort of covers the process of you know, as a big as a non
00:32:52 [W] Remember contributor you then go on to become a member after you like, you know construed a little bit and over time. He became you may become more familiar with an area of the code base and you might start reviewing PRS and eventually you get PR din to what weaveworks was an owner's file as a reviewer.
00:33:08 [W] You'll be sort of the first line of defense when it comes to reviewing PRS as they're coming in.
00:33:14 [W] Now after spending some time as a reviewer, you become a bit more of a subject matter expert in that area of the code base.
00:33:24 [W] You reviewed a bunch of PRS and you'll get promoted to an approver which means you can actually sign off and allow that code to be merged and you know, let's say you start to learn more about other areas and other areas under the Sig you may become a higher level
00:33:36 [W] Or like an entire sub-project.
00:33:44 [W] So you might graduate men cheat like sort of helping set goals and outline the milestones for the entire sub project itself and potentially eventually become a sickly and this in itself is is this whole thing is referred to as the ladder and
00:33:53 [W] The ladder and now for many the first big hurdle is making the jump from a non-member to member, but our mentoring initiatives are here to help people climb the ladder itself.
00:34:03 [W] And mentoring mentorship is just essential to overall project health.
00:34:12 [W] I was just talking about controller lifecycle and off-boarding.
00:34:20 [W] But mentoring is how we bring on new computers and help our current contributors grow into the roles and become set project owners and featured Sig leads. And with that we have a couple different programs. The first is meet our contributors.
00:34:28 [W] It is a one-hour sort of ask me anything with a panel of current contributors the audience for this is tends to be like a 50/50 split between both.
00:34:34 [W] New and current contributors and some of our more common questions include like, how do I get started?
00:34:41 [W] How can I get my PR reviewed faster? And how do I hunt down a flake?
00:34:44 [W] Next we have our group mentoring cohort where we are looking to work more with Sig's and sort of build a program targeting active contributors.
00:34:58 [W] This is specifically to get more reviewers improvers in a certain area of the code base.
00:35:08 [W] We have an initiative right now with Sig node, but we're looking to set some up with others. If you are a Sig lead or a sub-project owner and you're interested in this sort of thing. Please reach out if interested.
00:35:11 [W] Next is sort of a sort of broad category of Shadow programs.
00:35:21 [W] And this happens to be one of the best ways to build a path towards see a sustainable contributor base is to build a team with roles.
00:35:22 [W] And one more Shadows with the Assumption built into the shadow that the shadow will eventually take over the lead.
00:35:32 [W] So it's creating a self-sustaining cycle. And this has been used to great effect within both our release team and events teams.
00:35:37 [W] Next we have the one on one hour.
00:35:44 [W] This is something actually isn't used too much just because it requires a lot of time but we try and offer the ability for people to book time and ask questions with a more experienced contributor one-on-one.
00:35:55 [W] We also have two major internship programs working with Google for the Google summer of code and the Outreach e internship program.
00:36:00 [W] I believe both are done for the remainder of the year, but look like subscribe to the career step in list if you're interested in this sort of thing in the future.
00:36:10 [W] Next we have our new computer Workshop.
00:36:12 [W] This has its own slide itself.
00:36:17 [W] It happens to be one of our largest mentoring programs. And we tend we've really held it alongside contributor Summits and it actually used to be under the events sub-project, but it has since moved out
00:36:27 [W] Earlier this year and this is because hosting and person had a lot of difficulties.
00:36:34 [W] There are a lot of issues with Hotel Wi-Fi not working corporate laptops being locked down and it just led to a degraded experience.
00:36:47 [W] And so moving it to an online-only event where you can sort of make your own curriculum and it's sort of like the contents of sort of mirrors are contributor guide while diving deeper into fairy has like areas like local building testing as piecemeal approach means that if you like
00:36:55 [W] It's sort of like the contents of sort of mirrors are contributor guide while diving deeper into fairy has like areas like local building testing as piecemeal approach means that if you like you've already got going you're going vibrant setup. You can skip to the section that are more relevant to you
00:37:01 [W] You're going vibrant setup. You can skip to the sections that are more relevant to you such as the the like repo tour and if you're an experienced contributor, preferably with good or a good recording setup.
00:37:11 [W] We'd love your help tackling some of these sections of recording a good presentation for it.
00:37:25 [W] And with that that takes us to slacken from slack and for a you know, as we said we have a slack workspace.
00:37:28 [W] With over a hundred thousand users and maintaining a safe space for them can compose quite a challenge and we've sort of had to build our own tooling to help manage. It all now slack itself is not really designed for open communities and it sort of
00:37:41 [W] Our person if you have an issue with someone that doesn't really work so well and an open group and one of our contributors Catharine Barry built tooling that lets us manage slack through get as well as added some a like plug-in. So we now have a the function to be like
00:37:57 [W] And these things will sort of bubble up to our second and team for review.
00:38:06 [W] We also have some upcoming things that we intend to work on such as automating postings to announce its for things like security announcements as well as being able to delegate moderation capabilities to channel owners.
00:38:17 [W] This is because there are a lot of projects that are hosted within the Caray slack and for some we'd like to be able to or they like to be able to manage their own Community before potentially as to like bubble upper escalate to up to us as full stackrox.
00:38:27 [W] lack of mins
00:38:29 [W] Leslie this is not a subject but something that is very important to us.
00:38:40 [W] And that is the naming working group sick and Trebek's is one of the sponsors for this new working group.
00:38:45 [W] And sort of the idea behind it is to help establish a set of inclusive language and suggestions on how we can update different parts of the project one of the big things for on the conservative side.
00:38:55 [W] It will be the managing the eventual switch for the get master Branch to something else likely main at this point.
00:38:59 [W] And we are currently working with GitHub and sort of waiting to sort of see what they can do to help us with that migration process when this is scheduled to occur. You can expect quite a bit of like coms going out to the crazed of mailing list as well as on the Twitter and elsewhere.
00:39:15 [W] Set of inclusive language and suggestions on how we can update different parts of the project one of the big things for on the conservative side.
00:39:28 [W] It will be the managing the eventual switch for the get master Branch to something else likely main at this point and we are currently working with GitHub and sort of waiting to sort of see what they can do to help us with that migration process when this is scheduled to
00:39:29 [W] Um, yeah, we do make some software that people love love to use but for us the contributor experience is really what we're all about.
00:39:38 [W] So for us it's about our mission to make contributing contributing to kubernative easier and ensure that we have a diverse sustainable contributor base that will keep driving the project forward for years to come.
00:39:48 [W] So how do you actually get involved?
00:39:49 [W] Getting involved as easy as attending your very first Sig meeting joining us again mailing list will usually send you a meeting invite as well for that meeting.
00:40:01 [W] So in the beginning when I showed you that list of cigs it feel free to just kind of browse around we have links to all of their archives and then see what interests you most Sig's have reserved time for new people to introduce themselves during the meeting and co-chairs and
00:40:11 [W] A free to just kind of browse around we have links to all of their archives and then see what interests you most Sig's have reserved time for new people to introduce themselves during the meeting and co-chairs and experienced members of the communities.
00:40:14 [W] Community are almost always out on the lookout for new people to make them feel welcome.
00:40:18 [W] So feel free to join a meeting introduce yourself.
00:40:23 [W] tell us what you're interested in tell us why you're there, you know, you might be interested in joining to contribute or maybe there's a thing that you need fixed. For example.
00:40:33 [W] So just join the meeting and get involved and for that I have a son about some tips here on your very first Sig meeting.
00:40:38 [W] The first is always find a buddy.
00:40:42 [W] There's a saying that says if you want to go fast go by yourself if you want to go far go as a group.
00:40:53 [W] So for me initially when I was getting started in the community, I found a buddy who is able to help me someone that was at my same level and we kind of bounce ideas off of each other or if we got stuck with something we help each other out and I also regularly sought out someone who is more experienced who could help me out.
00:41:04 [W] As I was learning you can either find this among co-workers if you have poll workers that have worked in kubernative before or you could just find one in a Sig meeting.
00:41:11 [W] For example, volunteering the take notes is a very good way to learn what's going on in kubernative very quickly.
00:41:21 [W] Usually the co-chairs and tech leads are running the meeting who's ever is working on the thing that's being discussed on the agendas usually doing the meeting and they're usually needs to be someone to actually pay attention to take good.
00:41:29 [W] It's so that we could share those with the mailing list and the rest of the community.
00:41:37 [W] group, so for me initially when I was getting started in the community, I found a buddy who is able to help me someone that was at my same level and we kind of bounce ideas off of each other or if we got stuck with something we help each other out and I also regularly sought out someone who is more experienced
00:41:43 [W] The great way to kind of get yourself up to speed on who's who what they're working on and what what's important to people as as they as you attend the meeting attending regularly is also pretty important kubernative releases
00:41:57 [W] Year, usually so attending regularly if you miss A month's worth of meanings and it's a weekly meeting. You know, that is a lot of velocity that you've missed out on so usually I try to attend regularly, especially if it's something that you're really interested
00:42:12 [W] Of velocity that you've missed out on so usually I try to attend regularly, especially if it's something that you're really interested in if there are other parts of the project were only you're only mildly interested in you could just attend meetings on a less regular basis.
00:42:21 [W] Only mildly interested in you could just attend meetings on a less regular basis. Always remember that small Dependable contributions is always better than volunteering for the world and not being able to accomplish anything.
00:42:29 [W] We've all been there.
00:42:44 [W] You've you've found this great project that really your aim to you're starting to really like the people you see people that you admire doing so many great things and then you're going to want to go to Every Sig and volunteer for everything and then you're going to find yourself in a ball like an in the ball of nobl9.
00:42:45 [W] Anxiety wondering why you volunteered for all these things and you just started and now you have no idea where to get started. So you can start contributing. We have people who contribute one hour a month and I've done so consistently for years and that is a thing that you can always kind of
00:43:00 [W] And then you're going to find yourself in a ball like a tan in the ball of anxiety.
00:43:01 [W] Wondering why you volunteered for all these things and you just started and now you have no idea where to get started. So you can start contributing. We have people who contributed one hour a month and I've done so consistently for years and that is a thing that you can always kind of
00:43:02 [W] So do not bite off more than you could chew.
00:43:07 [W] No one's going to yell at you for not volunteering enough.
00:43:08 [W] You're the one doing us the favor.
00:43:21 [W] So do find something that is easy for you while you figure out what to do. And as you gain experience and figure out and start to meet other people and start to figure out where your exactly going to fit in the machine then at that
00:43:23 [W] To chew on some stuff Sig should have a list of get first issues.
00:43:30 [W] This is a GitHub label.
00:43:32 [W] We also use a help wanted label.
00:43:34 [W] So you see things have.
00:43:34 [W] Hey welcome.
00:43:37 [W] Here's you know, here's a list of good first issues.
00:43:47 [W] Feel free to dive in since everyone is busy. All the time in the project is so busy some cigs maintain these lists better than others. If you go to a Sig and they don't have these are they only have a few things that is also a great place because you can use your beginner's mind as a new
00:43:52 [W] It's so busy some cigs maintain these lists better than others. If you go to a Sig and they don't have these are they only have a few things that is also a great place because you can use your beginner's mind as a new person to kind of help us figure out what things are appropriate for
00:43:56 [W] To help us figure out what things are appropriate for new people and what things aren't so in some ways if you don't find what's good for new people to work on figuring that out.
00:44:06 [W] know it sounds kind of meta is a great way to contribute.
00:44:07 [W] We have plenty of non-code roll opportunities like the stream team so I can ministration but there are many many things in contributor experience that don't require elevated permissions or we can always use your help. So, please don't feel that you need to know go
00:44:23 [W] Contributor experience that don't require elevated permissions or we can always use your help.
00:44:24 [W] So please don't feel that you need to know go or python or be a programmer at all.
00:44:29 [W] We have a large group of people who come from program manager backgrounds and myself who are not an engineer. I come from a system administrator background. So together with all of these skills that we have.
00:44:39 [W] that is how the Sig gets things done. We do it together as opposed to trying to expect everyone to learn things that they're not proficient.
00:44:47 [W] It in and with that you can always find us on slunk with these handles and these are also a GitHub and handles that home page read me. There will take you to a summary that has the length of just about everything.
00:45:00 [W] I've talked about here links to our sub projects and things of that nature and then of course our could Trebek's mailing list, which has the asynchronous forms of communication. And with that. Thank you for joining us Bob. Any last words?
00:45:12 [W] Will this video all out there?
00:45:17 [W] and then hopefully we'll see you all at a real cute con. We're going to change Circle. You can eventually stay safe everyone. Thank you.
00:45:21 [W] That felt good.
00:45:27 [W] Yeah.
00:45:29 [W] Hello everyone.
00:45:38 [W] Can you all hear me should be able to?
00:45:39 [W] I am going to take some live questions here.
00:45:45 [W] The first one comes from Chris Ward says I'm interested in helping with the stream team, but I'm in Europe.
00:45:52 [W] Who should I contact myself or Bob is fine or if you go to the Sig contributor experience channel on the kubernative slack.
00:46:03 [W] There's just an entire group of us.
00:46:07 [W] I should have probably mentioned that in the slides.
00:46:15 [W] But yeah just show up and as start asking questions and someone in the group, there's a bunch of us in there that covers almost every time zone will be happy to answer your questions.
00:46:16 [W] Next one is from Peter O'Neill.
00:46:19 [W] Thanks for thanks for stopping by our their mentoring program links available somewhere.
00:46:28 [W] Yes. I plot that into the answer into the little widget there, but it is available in our slides.
00:46:32 [W] Usually Googling for kubernative mentorship programs will be the first or second link and as our contributor site goes live.
00:46:41 [W] Hub stuff Pamela Kelly asks a question that we did a dress, but I want to talk a little bit about says do you have any resources that provide advice on how to navigate projects and fight issues to tackle for new contributors?
00:46:57 [W] It could be difficult to navigate the projects issues and often good first issues are snapped up very quickly or sometimes you might find that you'll go to good first issues or help wanted issues for certain Sig and there might be one or two or you know
00:47:09 [W] The six it's our responsibility to maintain these tags full of new issues and things like that and that can fall behind in some cigs.
00:47:24 [W] I know that we do try to make an effort to do this are in our segment. But sometimes we do get behind that's one of those cases where just going to the meeting and letting someone know that you exist and you're interested in that thing is useful right I've
00:47:34 [W] That's one of those cases where just going to the meeting and letting someone know that you exist and you're interested in that thing is useful right?
00:47:35 [W] I've had I've had people tell me. Oh, okay. You need new issues.
00:47:42 [W] I wasn't I wasn't aware. Actually that people were looking at those.
00:47:43 [W] You know, that kind of thing.
00:47:47 [W] So definitely letting someone know that you're there that you're interested especially in a meeting because there's always something that is new the Sig just might not have the resources or the time to go and classify.
00:47:56 [W] Those bugs and things like that.
00:48:03 [W] So usually if you just pop into their channel into a meeting and then they know that someone is actively looking they probably already have a few issues off the top of their head.
00:48:11 [W] Let's see any other questions.
00:48:13 [W] I'm in slack and I'm in this little Q&A widget there.
00:48:17 [W] I know we only had four minutes of questions.
00:48:21 [W] anybody
00:48:31 [W] all right.
00:48:40 [W] Well, I guess that's it.
00:48:40 [W] I don't I don't really know what I do next.
00:48:44 [W] Oh, okay.
00:48:52 [W] So I guess that wraps it up.
00:49:00 [W] Thanks for coming everybody to the session and as always you can find us in the Sig contributor experience channel in the kubernative slack.
