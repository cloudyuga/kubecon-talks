00:00:00 [W] Hi everybody. Thank you for joining us for the navigate.
00:00:08 [W] Hi everybody. Thank you for joining us for the navigating your career and open source.
00:05:34 [W] We wish we could see you all in person, but we decided to gather and do this panel anyway virtually. So thanks for taking time to hang out with us.
00:05:38 [W] My name is Megan Bigelow and I'm the director of reliability engineering at VMware and I'm really excited to introduce a number of other people that are joining us today. So what we're each going to do is
00:05:48 [W] Say our name our job company and our little bit about our journey into open source. So you've met me but what I'd like to do is let you know that I've been in tech for about 20 years and I started my career all the way at the
00:06:03 [W] I'm pretty much the beginning which was helped us.
00:06:07 [W] I worked my way up to desktop support and then systems Administration and from there.
00:06:15 [W] I was able to Parlay into a role in management. And after I spent some years managing tech support teams.
00:06:22 [W] I had an opportunity to join Hefty.
00:06:29 [W] Oh and Lead their customer reliability engineering team, which is where I got my first start and open source. So what I'd like to do is oh I will
00:06:33 [W] so I wanted to mention that this is my second Cube con. The first one I went to was last year and I'll go ahead and turn it over to Rio so she can introduce yourself.
00:06:44 [W] Thanks Megan.
00:06:45 [W] Hi everyone.
00:06:46 [W] My name is Rhea Bhatia.
00:06:54 [W] I used to work for Microsoft as a program manager and I started out as an intern there through the Explorer program and then p.m.
00:06:54 [W] Internships and I'll be joining Niantic actually when this air is will be this week. So I'm really excited and at Microsoft I was within the
00:07:03 [W] Upstream team, so I've worked on open source projects like virtual kubelet and some other ones like cluster API and this will be I think my sixth coupon. So that's kind of crazy and fast.
00:07:17 [W] Do you want to go next?
00:07:18 [W] Thank you, Maria.
00:07:21 [W] Hello everyone. I'm faster Kiki.
00:07:24 [W] I'm a specialist solution architect at Red Hat.
00:07:28 [W] I started my career Journey similar to making actually I started with technical support then throughout the years. I got into Linux system administration IT consulting and pre-sales and that's the path that is taking me here today
00:07:41 [W] But I work at dry-ass. Hi, this is my second coupon first time. I had the opportunity to be there in Austin 2017, and I'm really happy to be here now.
00:07:54 [W] I'd like James to go next, please.
00:07:55 [W] Thanks very much.
00:07:59 [W] Yeah, I'm James Finley.
00:08:01 [W] I'm based out of the UK.
00:08:05 [W] I think this is I had to count earlier.
00:08:07 [W] I think this is actually my 8 cubic on the first one was back in London.
00:08:13 [W] So yeah, it's quite a long time ago then and only a handful of people.
00:08:20 [W] Yeah. I have been working at jet stack for the last three and a half years or so where I've built the alongside team of others the set manager project which
00:08:27 [W] That pungent a list of gets in giving it two clusters right now.
00:08:32 [W] I am in the process of moving to a new job.
00:08:33 [W] So yeah, and yeah over to Rachel.
00:08:37 [W] Hi, I'm Rachel leakin.
00:08:42 [W] I'm a kubernative field engineer at VMware.
00:08:44 [W] I'm located in New York.
00:08:47 [W] I'm also in the area of Megan.
00:08:49 [W] I work alongside with her team. I started VMware about over a year ago.
00:08:55 [W] And before that I was at IBM as a cloud architect a cloud consultant a cloud engineer.
00:09:01 [W] So I basically been in the clouds bait most space most of my career.
00:09:04 [W] This is my first Cube con.
00:09:05 [W] So I'm super excited for this and my journey and open.
00:09:07 [W] Is just when I started here at VMware, I got involved with the my team and they really pushed open source.
00:09:18 [W] So my first commit was actually a couple of months ago with opa.
00:09:19 [W] All right.
00:09:22 [W] Thank you Rachel and everyone.
00:09:27 [W] So we're going to kick off this panel by talking a little bit about what important things happen to us that helped us get to where we are today.
00:09:37 [W] So as many do when they're when they're planning a panel, they spend a lot of time hanging out with the panelists.
00:09:38 [W] So we've had a ton of great conversations leading up to this important day and I've gotten to know everyone in the panel quite well, it's really exciting.
00:09:46 [W] So I'd like to first ask Rachel to tell us a little bit about her journey from
00:09:50 [W] You know IBM and what was one of the things that was so critical to get her going?
00:09:56 [W] Thanks Megan.
00:10:01 [W] So yeah, so I started straight out of school at IBM.
00:10:04 [W] Not really sure exactly what I want to do, but I got a great opportunity to join a new team where they allowed us to explore different opportunities and rolls and I end up going down the cloud architect Tech pack first and what really got me
00:10:16 [W] To where I am now is I was able to Shadow someone for months sit with them every day on calls.
00:10:24 [W] We're through architectural diagrams with them and it was just really a great experience that I don't think he can get hey now with doing the covid times, but but before, you know, just having someone with you every day and whose has 20 years of
00:10:37 [W] Expertise in that industry.
00:10:40 [W] So that's really what got me on this path to where I am today.
00:10:43 [W] In fact, why don't you tell us a little bit about your experience with maybe some non-traditional mentorship from some of the things that you found online maybe people didn't even know that you were they were mentoring you especially important in covid x
00:11:00 [W] Absolutely.
00:11:02 [W] Yes, that's right.
00:11:06 [W] So I didn't have the privilege of having a physical Mentor.
00:11:10 [W] I never worked in a position that I could have a structured mentorship program.
00:11:17 [W] So that meant that any projects that I got involved with and any problems new problems that I faced.
00:11:23 [W] I was kind of being thrown at the deep end and I was on my own having to find a way up as daunting the stressful that was to begin with. I'm kind of glad
00:11:32 [W] gone through that experience because I do believe experiences like that help you become more resourceful and also give you the confidence to believe in your own abilities or which is something that's been helpful throughout my career
00:11:45 [W] And also in other aspects of life, but going back to how I would find these Solutions or the support I needed. So the good thing about open source is the Fantastic Community behind it.
00:12:00 [W] And any time I was facing a problem.
00:12:07 [W] I would go to a forum or a mailing list and I would find a number of people who are happy to have and at times I would find myself somebody virtually mentoring me throughout the project. I was doing somebody that I've never met before and they probably live like
00:12:16 [W] Living on the other side of the world.
00:12:29 [W] So it was a great experience. And that's one of the great things about the specifically open source, which were lucky to be working with at the in this day and age and another good thing about turkey's as the days go past the amount of information
00:12:33 [W] Nation is available at our fingertips compared to when I started about just over to at work back 15 years ago. The amount of information that's available right now is not even comparable to what was available back. Then there's so many online resources
00:12:48 [W] You can go to and so the good thing is that if you want to success succeed at the career in Tech, all you need to have is just courage and determination and an internet connection, and then you're well on your way to success really.
00:13:05 [W] Thanks for as that actually resonates with me quite a lot and just to re-expand.
00:13:11 [W] She used to work at Microsoft.
00:13:17 [W] I lived and died by the Microsoft forms and my early days the thanks to all those people that were contributing to them.
00:13:18 [W] So given that we now basically sit in front of a computer all day and use Virtual meetings for literally everything including educating our children.
00:13:32 [W] I wanted to talk about a real topic that hits all of us, which is burnout.
00:13:37 [W] Andrea has a few thoughts on this that I thought would be great to kick off and then maybe after that we can go to James. So go ahead and read and tell us about your recent experience with Bernal.
00:13:45 [W] Yeah, so about two years into Microsoft, so maybe about a year ago.
00:13:51 [W] I experienced a lot of burnout and I didn't really realize what was happening until I was almost out of it I think and the reason was not because I had too much work.
00:14:05 [W] I'm honestly it was really because of just some random roadblocks that we couldn't pass on our own. It wasn't something that I could control and that was really difficult and I think a lot of people especially early in Korea.
00:14:17 [W] Face these problems and are like wait, this is something I actually can't solve in a lot of us take it personally.
00:14:25 [W] For a while, but I had a lot of great support thankfully made manager some great mentors at Microsoft who helped me come out of that burnout, but also gave me space to just recuperate to learn on my own and then gave me a great project to jump into
00:14:38 [W] Once I was ready, and I'm really thankful for that.
00:14:48 [W] So it's super real and I think now that we're sitting in front of our computers every single day like working from home is a different experience and now we're exhausted from just listening to the news from just living day to day and thinking about oh
00:14:56 [W] That I catch the virus like or did my family members and I think that's very real and yeah, I'm not sure but I'm wondering also how you guys are James how you guys have been dealing with burned out or just the day-to-day?
00:15:10 [W] I don't know if that was next question. But yeah, I mean, I think it's like a lot of what you say that resonates.
00:15:22 [W] It's very difficult to recognize. I know when we talked about this a few days ago. It was like, you know, you don't really ever know if you've got burnout and then all of a sudden you're like, wow, I like really don't want to actually do anything and
00:15:33 [W] Yeah, you almost you feel like you want to go outside and do things because you've just got to get away from this but then you also end out feeling like, you know, you're just exhausted.
00:15:45 [W] Actually, it's just easier just to stay in so I think it can be really hard.
00:15:52 [W] And yeah, I mean personally for me, I think what were the project like set manager as well. I've poured a lot of time and effort into that and I guess it's very easy and I think I haven't really got
00:16:00 [W] Exact piece of advice to I think it's very easy to lose track of things like that and just get really involved in it and really engrossed and I think really what it comes down to it.
00:16:12 [W] It's not at any point.
00:16:13 [W] You're not going to feel like it's a bad thing.
00:16:15 [W] You're going to be enjoying yourself and whatever else but you start to realize that it's kind of the only thing that's on your mind and I think that can be really like that's a bit of a warning sign if that's something that's just constantly there. You know, your phone's going off you're looking at that all the time
00:16:29 [W] I'm and yeah, it's very important to try and one was just half five. No turn it off walk away and actually just go do something else and that's a lot easier said than done.
00:16:41 [W] I know that's like yeah.
00:16:42 [W] First what do you do to help with burnout and tips?
00:16:48 [W] Well, my experience is a slightly different to what you just described because I was traveling right crazy just before the lag time.
00:17:00 [W] So I find this time to be quite nice and calming I sleep in my own bed.
00:17:07 [W] I can have it exercise routine again.
00:17:12 [W] So it's kind of been nice to begin with but I think it's a started to get to me now, but the things I normally do that things that I've developed throughout the years throughout the non-life.
00:17:21 [W] Knocked on the band Nats been like things like going for a run.
00:17:26 [W] Just getting outside and going for a walk.
00:17:31 [W] I find that very very hurtful. And the other thing that I've found tremendously helpful is meditation.
00:17:41 [W] I just try to just meditate every day. When I start my day said my intention and meditate I don't have to be a mind to do that only like 10 minutes or even five minutes every day.
00:17:44 [W] Just focusing on breathing.
00:17:47 [W] I found out to be really really helpful.
00:17:48 [W] Awesome. Thank you. And I know Rachel you have a special show that you watch or two that helps you kind of deal with burnout or any process this covid. You want to share what you do?
00:18:03 [W] Okay.
00:18:14 [W] Well if it's okay, I think what is it like 90 minutes fiance or something?
00:18:14 [W] So anyway, 90 day fiancé.
00:18:17 [W] Yes.
00:18:20 [W] All right. Well Rachel are you back with us?
00:18:22 [W] I am kale hear me.
00:18:26 [W] Yeah, yeah.
00:18:28 [W] Okay.
00:18:34 [W] Yes. I do have a show but I just picked up a new show like as of like like so it's something about matchmaking.
00:18:40 [W] I can't remember the whole title, but it's on Netflix.
00:18:41 [W] Oh, that's my new burnout relaxation. Shush.
00:18:44 [W] That's awesome.
00:18:45 [W] Thank you. Okay. So what I'd like to do now is move on to a part of our panel where we talk about what personal steps we each are taking to encourage other people, especially a broad audience.
00:18:58 [W] dominant culture folks to be a part of Open Source think Benny has of us know that being able to contribute to open source requires a tremendous amount of free time and not everyone has access to free time or necessarily
00:19:13 [W] You know direct access to the skills that it takes or they might feel like they don't have the skills that it takes even though that isn't true.
00:19:23 [W] So I'd like to start with Rachel.
00:19:28 [W] I know you're participating a lot in some activities at work.
00:19:32 [W] Can you tell us how you were encouraging other people to get more involved in open source?
00:19:34 [W] Yeah.
00:19:44 [W] Yep, so, I'm actually on the black at VMware pot which is an ERG here at VMware and what I personally I'm the remote lead for that.
00:19:51 [W] So I'm personally trying to get people in different minority groups. So it's not just a black pot but the Latin poddisruptionbudgets.
00:20:05 [W] Have been exposed to so I am trying to leave that exposure and kind of encourage them to explore the possibilities by doing tekton --ax with them and showcasing them how and giving them steps on how they can get involved slowly right
00:20:20 [W] Without having it being overwhelming especially since we all have our day jobs.
00:20:25 [W] Thanks, Rachel.
00:20:30 [W] Okay, James uses have spent a lot of time moderating the kubernetes community, which I think we now have what over a hundred thousand people in it.
00:20:38 [W] Can you tell us a little bit about that experience and how you feel like that contributes or how you can sort of Leverage your influence to bring a broader space a for space Brothers?
00:20:51 [W] yeah, so for anyone that doesn't know the kubenetes slack as you say Megan, I think it's something around about a hundred thousand people on there and as of year and a half two years ago, we have actually established a much a much more formal
00:21:06 [W] Kind of process and administration and a plan for everything.
00:21:16 [W] So within the slack Community, obviously, we have our guidelines. We've got the cncf code of conduct we kind of inherent and then extend with some more specific to slack sort of I think it's the communication guidelines.
00:21:24 [W] You'll find it on the kubenetes community repo but kind of beyond that.
00:21:29 [W] It's very easy to have a document.
00:21:32 [W] It's a bit harder to make sure that people follow it. So Katherine who worked on
00:21:36 [W] on the entrepot team at Google put together a whole load of new slack automation for us.
00:21:45 [W] So we've now got things like the report message feature that people can use to privately report any message that they see across the community to us as administrators and we make sure we are globally distributed so someone at all times while at least
00:21:57 [W] I think it's at least two or three people at all times there to stuff it and you know, it's fairly informal is mostly volunteer run.
00:22:07 [W] I don't think any one of the major contributors specifically dedicates a you know, an individual to to work on community movement like go slack administration at least but yeah, so we have that there and I think it's especially
00:22:20 [W] Important because I mean even in the time that we've been doing it, you see odd messages and kind of well, it really does go from you know, the odd weird message or something that's been advertising.
00:22:35 [W] He said you definitely see a lot of passive aggressive sort of behavior and things like that. And I think it's important that these things are dealt with promptly because otherwise if you come back four hours late to five hours later and then start responding it already has an effect people see it and
00:22:48 [W] It starts to set the tone for the whole community and I think you know these small things they all kind of add up and then when it comes to someone who's just got a bit of a question, they don't know what they're doing.
00:23:00 [W] They don't know how to get involved.
00:23:05 [W] It can make people from really uncomfortable. If you know the last time someone asked a question.
00:23:07 [W] They got a let me Google that for you link back that just, you know tells them read the docs and it's you know, it's not constructive to help anyone. So yeah.
00:23:16 [W] Thanks, James and first you have taken a slightly different approach you work with Academia, can you tell us a little bit about that sure so as I'm quite fortunate to work for a
00:23:32 [W] Panini that not only given me this lovely Fedora which are like to wear for pile shows but also allows me to be quite active in the open source space. So whatever I do at work is sort of contribution to open source space, but on top of that I'm also
00:23:47 [W] Om involved with it.
00:23:52 [W] They both universities that I graduated from and volunteered as a mentor is specifically for female graduates, and I'm hoping by doing that. I'll be able to give back and also try to encourage and kind of a
00:24:04 [W] Racked more Talent into the space and also with the situation that going on at the moment.
00:24:17 [W] Unfortunately with a lot of job losses are the moment. There are people some of my friends who've lost their jobs.
00:24:18 [W] So whatever whoever that comes to me and we talked about it. I just encourage them to learn coding as like, you know, what if you wanna if you want a career for Life go learn coding and to get involved the best ways to get him off with open source projects. So I'm just like
00:24:32 [W] Like a booking advertise machine for open source contribution right now.
00:24:38 [W] Awesome.
00:24:39 [W] Thank you.
00:24:49 [W] And when we all got a chance to hang out earlier this week Rio was telling us about a cool thing that Microsoft had started doing related to asking people to file tickets upstream and I'm can you tell us some more about that because I can totally see
00:24:54 [W] But being a really great way to get lots of people to contribute.
00:25:09 [W] Yeah, it's definitely so especially in the Upstream team. We a lot of the projects that we create and work the Open Source Community like a lot of our customers end up loving those projects and but they're at the thing
00:25:13 [W] They're used to going through like our Microsoft process of filing a ticket with us or trying to reach us internally.
00:25:23 [W] And so what we've been trying to do and especially when I was there was actually push these customers to engage with us in the open source community.
00:25:31 [W] So that's joining the kubernative slack or a filing an issue because we also automatically any open source issues that have open source projects.
00:25:37 [W] We actually close those tickets. So none of our Engineers end up seeing those tickets because ideally all of that should be
00:25:43 [W] Focused through open source, which is great because then we start to get more open source engagement.
00:25:54 [W] We get more usage. We get sometimes bug fixes from these customers because they're actually using this stuff. And so yeah, I think it's been great and I hope to continue that and major any through kubernative use
00:26:01 [W] Awesome. Okay, so we're running out of time.
00:26:08 [W] So I what I wanted to do is just close this panel up with a key takeaway.
00:26:17 [W] So we'll go around the room and will say a final one minute thought about what we think is a key takeaway for our audience and I'll go ahead and get started.
00:26:26 [W] So as I mentioned at the beginning of this panel, I'm not hiring manager and my role as a hiring manager is to obviously bring people into my
00:26:30 [W] My team and that's a very important in huge responsibility.
00:26:38 [W] Call out is to other folks who are responsible for teams big and small to consider your role as a hiring manager a strong and important duty and responsibility to the broader community and you can do this by ensuring that
00:26:49 [W] Have put systems in place to bring about broader set of candidates into your into your pipelines to encourage people to apply to ensure that the that you as a manager you
00:27:04 [W] Reflecting on your own decisions.
00:27:08 [W] I have lots of ideas of how to do it. But the reality is is that it can really start with very brass tacks simple steps that can have extremely tremendous and positive impact and especially working for the part
00:27:21 [W] Um, we're that's responsible for bringing in Talent to work on open source, or to be involved in open source Community.
00:27:32 [W] I feel like it's my duty to take that role. Seriously. Okay, Rachel. Would you like to see your key takeaway?
00:27:38 [W] Sure for me personally. I think that you should just no matter what your skill set is just to look for something and try to make a contribution.
00:27:48 [W] It could be very small. So it give you something that is you saw a spelling error in the
00:27:53 [W] The documentation right?
00:27:59 [W] It doesn't have to be something that's on the issues list, right? It could be something you were just reading through it.
00:28:04 [W] You saw a narrow you want to open up an issue and then use try to fix it yourself, right?
00:28:10 [W] So that's a good way to get started and it doesn't it doesn't matter what your skill set is if you're not a strong coder or a strong front-end back-end, whatever it is.
00:28:18 [W] There's something out there for you and it doesn't also have to be one of the major projects like Cooper Nettie's it could be one of the smaller.
00:28:24 [W] It's open, you know Upstream projects. So look around and see whatever it is that your skills strong said is and try to get involved that way.
00:28:31 [W] Really?
00:28:34 [W] How about you not?
00:28:34 [W] Cool. So my takeaway is something a little different.
00:28:53 [W] It's a related to mentorship but it's something that I'm actually actively doing right now, but build out a set of like a board of advisers and these are people that are possibly in positions that you want to get in the next couple of years or maybe long-term goals, and these are
00:28:56 [W] You can talk to about your career industry and hopefully it just ask them more questions about what's going on at work.
00:29:11 [W] And yeah, so I would highly encourage you to do that and it's really easy through open source to meet so many different people through different companies and I think that's been so special that I've now getting mentors across different companies through open source.
00:29:18 [W] How about you fast and then James?
00:29:24 [W] Yes, so it's real life.
00:29:30 [W] So no matter what stage of our carrier.
00:29:33 [W] We're at we're going to face that backs whether we like it or not.
00:29:36 [W] My advice would be if you're facing a problem.
00:29:43 [W] Do not lose the faith in faith in yourself. And also don't forget who you are.
00:29:45 [W] I believe nobody you feel that they have to change in order to fit into a career in Tech.
00:29:50 [W] That should not be there so believe in yourself and stay authentic.
00:29:54 [W] Yeah, yeah, I guess my takeaway I think.
00:30:01 [W] I don't we split into two one side. It's kind of as a someone who might have more experience in an open source project.
00:30:17 [W] I think it's very important to make sure that you kind of like self-aware and aware of how the words you say. Once they may be like factually correct or technically the best thing to do.
00:30:25 [W] Like how you're conveying that and who you're talking to and sort of if if you need to write a big wall of text explaining like oh no this is wrong because this and the other maybe consider not writing a huge wall of text and actually communicating with them to help
00:30:38 [W] The stand because they like that contributor may have going to copy and paste it a big bit of code and dropped it in and just got it working. And that is a useful contribution.
00:30:49 [W] They're sharing what they need their requirements there everything like that.
00:31:00 [W] But you know, sometimes it does take a bit of work to do it and I think that can help really build out and strengthening community and then on the other side as someone coming along to a new project.
00:31:06 [W] like I think one of the things for me at least I think of helped me to communicate with other people who have
00:31:12 [W] More experience is to go through and actually make very clear where I don't understand things.
00:31:14 [W] So just taking a look at your own poor a quest and going through and just adding a note saying like I'm actually not sure if this is correct and just highlight these areas because it can be very difficult to you know know why something didn't doubt that way, you know
00:31:29 [W] Sites that as a maintainer or as a contributor, so yeah, I think thank you.
00:31:41 [W] All right. So this is the end of our panel and navigating your current open source.
00:31:46 [W] Thank you for spending time with us. And hopefully we'll see you all again in a future coupon.
00:31:46 [W] Have a good time.
00:31:49 [W] Thank you.
00:31:49 [W] Thank you.
00:31:50 [W] Thank you.
00:31:50 [W] Thank you. Thank you.
00:31:52 [W] Hi everybody.
00:32:01 [W] Thank you for listening to our panel and we are really excited to be here with all of you to answer some questions.
00:32:12 [W] We're really lucky that we have everyone that was in the pre-recording here today, even though some of us are in the US and it's a little bit early on the West Coast.
00:32:21 [W] The first question that we are going to answer is what kind of job titles indicate open source work. So I'll take that and then
00:32:25 [W] Direct it to see if she has anything else what I found in the two years that I've been involved in open source, is that the job titles are there isn't it? There isn't a lot of clarity in the job title itself.
00:32:41 [W] Generally if you are working within a business unit or a department at a company that does a lot of Open Source work. Most of the engineering titles are going to also have a open source component. But as you will have you heard in this panel?
00:32:55 [W] All of us have very different titles and we all have some relationship to open source. So it's not a foregone conclusion.
00:33:05 [W] So what I would recommend is during the hiring process, you know doing your research in terms of the companies and the business units within those companies what those groups names are and try to align yourself with roles that are open in those groups
00:33:18 [W] Do you have anything to add to that?
00:33:20 [W] Can you hear me?
00:33:26 [W] Yes.
00:33:27 [W] Now I agree there isn't there isn't much I could ask so I totally agree with what you went through.
00:33:35 [W] Awesome, cool.
00:33:38 [W] Thank you.
00:33:39 [W] Okay. So the next question is how do you all handle work and open source contributions or does your work involve open source contributions, and I'm going to ask Rachel to take that question.
00:33:53 [W] Yeah, so I've actually been lucky where my role does have some open source component to it.
00:34:03 [W] It's not like a full requirement of my role but my management team and the people around me all are involved in that in the open source community and they actually provide a lot of contributions.
00:34:15 [W] So they've also encouraged me to do it. So it's my choice, but I'm able to incorporate it into my everyday work if I choose to.
00:34:23 [W] Thank you, Rachel.
00:34:28 [W] Okay.
00:34:36 [W] So the next question is are you all working on open source as a part of your day job or is it more like a side hustle on both scenarios?
00:34:40 [W] How do you handle the balance? Do you get support from your employer? And James is going to take that one.
00:34:45 [W] Yeah, so I mean speaking for myself like I do work as part of my full-time job on open source. I think it's obviously a lot of us have a lot of internal things to work on to and
00:35:01 [W] One of the things that is like one of the things that's important there to be able to get the time to contribute and actually work with in the Upstream Community is kind of demonstrating to your like managers in your reporting chain that like, it's
00:35:16 [W] Just you wanting to do something fun.
00:35:31 [W] This is something that is bringing value back to the company and like how you pinpoint exactly that and kind of sell it because it is almost a sale in some companies, especially if your company isn't so open source first can be difficult, but I think
00:35:34 [W] You know almost demonstrating if we go off and Fork this project or build something internal then all of these benefits that we're getting from cloud native technology everything that you've kind of built yourself up to go and use something like keeping it.
00:35:49 [W] He's already you start to lose because you are now building your own site load Walled Garden again, instead of working within that wider community. So in turn, you know, a new project comes out that integrates with I can people zettabytes.
00:36:03 [W] Until you know say tekton comes out and support something like certain energy if your organization's develop its own certificate management tooling you can't just benefit from that so you can always sell it there on the cost that they're going to have to come along and then build the next integration and the
00:36:18 [W] On the next one but I do think it's kind of down to your organization to type of work you're trying to do and then in terms of balance as well. How did you keep the balance between them?
00:36:32 [W] I think that's also difficult because it can you can quite quickly lead to kind of burnout and things like that if you're working too much and not getting support you need so making sure that your manager does support you in what you're doing making sure that they do understand
00:36:44 [W] You're doing these things and not just doing it as a secret but being quite open about the fact that you are contributing and promoting that yeah.
00:36:54 [W] Awesome. Thanks James Okay. So we've got another question on Deck. There's quite a few it's really exciting.
00:37:05 [W] And this one's directed to Ria.
00:37:09 [W] Will you talk on how to get paid doing open source?
00:37:15 [W] I think that's a really important question that a lot of people want the answer to yeah.
00:37:18 [W] It's also a hard question to answer because there's I think a couple different ways, but first of all, I'm is really exciting could have rolled out a program where if you have a
00:37:27 [W] His contributions and open source tool actually pay you anything. Some people had got some Hefty sentence from that program.
00:37:37 [W] So you can definitely check that out. If you don't if you're not private company Etc and you want to do something independently.
00:37:44 [W] Otherwise, I think the Honestly though, unfortunately the best way to do open source is through your full-time job and making it a part of your role whether it's a like a side project you're working on or whether
00:37:55 [W] It's like your core role.
00:38:02 [W] There's open source projects across the board and I'm sure I could fit in almost any kind of industry.
00:38:08 [W] So that would be kind of amazing. If you could talk with your manager pair that out. I think it's the best way honestly is through your role.
00:38:11 [W] And you get paid so makes Rhea.
00:38:17 [W] Yeah, definitely getting paid is extremely important Okay, so we've got another question here and this time I'm sending it right back to James at my company.
00:38:32 [W] It is a real issue to contribute to open source because of either my company's my customer or both policies and contracts.
00:38:38 [W] Do you have any experience or guides to help on that situation?
00:38:41 [W] Yeah. I mean our kind of cool back.
00:38:42 [W] I was saying before, you know, it's those the legal things to policies and contracts. They're not something that well depending on the size of your organization.
00:38:52 [W] They're not necessarily easy to change.
00:38:54 [W] So I think you do need to get by in there.
00:38:59 [W] And if you're in a place that doesn't kind of by default see the value in it, then you need to start small there.
00:39:09 [W] Unfortunately, I think and it's kind of the way it is. If you're if you're somewhere where you've got, you know, there is a little bit more open to open source contribution things. It may be is more a case of piecing together.
00:39:16 [W] They're in connecting the right people up, you know the advocates for open source as well as legal and then someone above them who can sort of negotiating and actually kind of talk through with these various teams kind of the value and why this needs to happen.
00:39:27 [W] Yes, certainly with kind of contract and policies.
00:39:45 [W] I think that can be that's certainly one of the hardest bit.
00:39:45 [W] I know getting something through a legal department is not a fun activity to also thank you James.
00:39:46 [W] Okay, we're almost out of time and we have one more we're going to have time for one more question.
00:39:49 [W] Okay, so this is directed to you.
00:39:54 [W] If as I'm getting confused when I want to join open source projects for contribution. Could you suggest a few project for who?
00:39:59 [W] It's to start an open source.
00:39:59 [W] Sure, there's plenty of stuff. You can get involved with some of the immediate to stuff that are the things that close to me.
00:40:09 [W] I can suggest would be with the Upstream version of openshift, which is called.
00:40:13 [W] Okay, D if you wanted a kubernative space to contribute related to space and also I personally A specialized in as possible. If you want something other than just pure kubernative a WX project would be something you can
00:40:28 [W] Sub working guy.
00:40:29 [W] All right, folks. We are at the end of our Q&A period this is our chance to say goodbye to all of you.
00:40:41 [W] Thanks for hanging out and we hope to see you all again it sometimes in the future coupon.
00:40:46 [W] Goodbye everyone.
00:40:47 [W] Hi.
