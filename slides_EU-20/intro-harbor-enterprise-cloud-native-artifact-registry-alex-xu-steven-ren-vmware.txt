00:00:00 [W] Good morning.
00:00:03 [W] Good afternoon, or good evening, depending on where you are.
00:00:06 [W] We're very happy that you can attend this session and today myself and my co-presenter.
00:00:12 [W] We'll talk a little bit about the harbor project.
00:00:15 [W] So this is supposed to be an introductory session.
00:00:17 [W] It's gonna be fairly light and will give up sort of high-level overview of the harbor group registry and what it is why you might need it and the current status of the project a couple some of the things that we worked on for the last couple of releases.
00:00:30 [W] and then there's also a deep dive session where our Engineers will go into more details on some of the
00:00:37 [W] Specific features they're coming out in 2011 release the upcoming release and then we have a demo prepare for you today as well.
00:00:48 [W] It will be the last time ten minutes for Q&A.
00:00:50 [W] So quick introduction Alex you I'm a product manager in cloudevents Hema Boomer leading without proper effort.
00:00:58 [W] some trying to be responsible for China and are standing requirements around the registry driving the roadmap collecting feedback and make some sugar work constantly improving and seeing sustained.
00:01:08 [W] Active in the community and with me today is my co-presenter receiving room.
00:01:12 [W] Steven however long that Smith you and the bear could come to join our Harbor and stock session and I made the steal and so I'm looking for Harbor as an engineer manager in winner.
00:01:27 [W] So I mean irresponsible for developing a feature and manually release in the same time even may also manage the Telecom that it's good equation product.
00:01:39 [W] All right. Thank you Stephen.
00:01:49 [W] So what is Harbor and while Harbor is a trusted cloudevents tree that can store sign it scan content.
00:01:58 [W] we set out to build an on-prem registry leveraging the Constitution which was the de facto standard for storing and containerd which is at the time but we also wanted to address on the issues that we came across while using Docker Hub in some of the other Alternatives
00:02:16 [W] Over time we've added more and more services and features to it. Like a cycle management features security feature was like scanning and signing and so our mission is right now is still to be the best cloud native registry for communities.
00:02:32 [W] And we started support for Docker images and then expand it to helm charts in the 1.6 release and now with it will see I just the main thing for the 2.0 release that I'll talk about a little bit we can support any oci compatible artifacts.
00:02:49 [W] So this is a quick timeline of the project.
00:02:59 [W] The biggest announcement is time around is that we have officially reached graduated status and cncf and becomes the 11th project in cncf to do so along with projects, like kubernative containerd e Helm word
00:03:11 [W] Graduated status and cncf and becomes the 11th project in cncf to do so along with projects like kubernative containerd e Helm more Prometheus and so you can see that we start this journey back in 2014.
00:03:14 [W] So we put a lot of work and attention into it.
00:03:24 [W] And so we're very happy and we're very proud of what we've accomplished but you cannot have done this without everyone in the community including all you guys on the call today and the community plays a huge role in helping us understand test.
00:03:29 [W] Be back and sort of driving the road map with us.
00:03:35 [W] So we're very appreciative of everyone's contribution here.
00:03:47 [W] And in the project region graduated status means that it's hit a certain level of maturity, but it's really the potential and the roadmap that drives this decision.
00:03:49 [W] So this is a quick overview of the various pieces or capabilities that make up Harbor and I will just go over a couple of these real quick.
00:04:04 [W] First thing is Access Control can use local DB ldap or oid seat at the harbor and manage your users and their permissions into Harbor projects. If you're not familiar with Harbor projects think of it as like a namespace so, you know tendency and has its own set
00:04:18 [W] Is that are completely isolated from each other.
00:04:29 [W] We also have you about accounts for service account ci/cd type of scenarios to automate the pushing and pulling of images.
00:04:30 [W] And you can configure replication is referring to the ability to configure push-based or pull based replication policies to and from other registries.
00:04:46 [W] So that could be a Harper that also be something like Docker Hub or quickly or any of the other popular SAS Registries like gcra cre CR and then we have the ability to scan images from within Harbor leveraging popular image scanners
00:04:53 [W] Claire encore
00:04:57 [W] tribute by security and a couple of others and then once you have those vulnerabilities the list of vulnerabilities discovered from the image scans, you can actually create security policies around these so you can create a processes.
00:05:13 [W] each point on images with certain vulnerabilities
00:05:18 [W] You can also sign images leveraging copper content trust which comes with Harbor and likewise create image pouring policies based on these on the signature.
00:05:34 [W] So for example, you can say something like prevent any unsigned image from being deployed.
00:05:35 [W] We also support managing Helm charts. So previously this was done in the third party extension that we have added to.
00:05:46 [W] We had added called Char Museum, but with the 2.0 you can now push these directly to the registry and they said alongside your container in the edges.
00:05:53 [W] So every single web console that you can do everything for managing your artifacts your users and your policies running snyk on tasks like garbage collection and everything you can do on UI you can do through an API.
00:06:08 [W] And finally, we have a couple deployments the harbor. So there's a duck compose format, you know for deploying Harbor as a kubernative closer.
00:06:16 [W] going to come charge and Bosh is another container orchestrator that's used very heavily in Cloud Foundry.
00:06:26 [W] So this is an overview of the harbor latest Harper 2.0 architecture makeup, you can see that where it's still based around the doctor distribution still a crucial piece of the harbor and go in front top, you know, we have a bunch of clients. You can interact with Harbor through its Opera CLI.
00:06:46 [W] It Helm client and since 2.0 see support for all these additional Claudia tartuffe at types.
00:06:58 [W] They'll be there are other clients that different artifact authors that build for interacting with the registry.
00:07:08 [W] So for example, or is one such client that's been very popular for pushing a lot of generic oci artifacts like Jose indexes and also push Helm charts and close open policy agents, which art museum is still here so you can post them
00:07:13 [W] In the top distribution, but we do have clients of deprecated or anything in the future.
00:07:20 [W] Then on the on the right hand side, we have a list of supported scanners scanners are added in out of tree fashion to Harbor for pluggable interrogation services framework, and we talked a lot about this in the 1.9 release.
00:07:35 [W] To Harbor Thor pluggable interrogation services framework and we talked a lot about this in the 110 release, but we do have some changes related to the default scanner that I'll talk about in a later slide
00:07:42 [W] Have some changes related to the default scanner that I'll talk about in a later slide.
00:07:43 [W] And finally, we've expended a list of reputation targets.
00:07:51 [W] So you reckon knots just to Harbor and Docker Hub and but a lot of the other says for just reasons. Well, you can replicate you know, all these other artifacts now Beyond just containerd magician Helm charts, but obviously that also depends on the support ability of these archives
00:08:00 [W] So if you see me cncf announcement at least block around Harbor 2.0 Harbor 2.0 is all about you know, Harbor becoming it was a compliant registry and so we should talk a little bit about what it means.
00:08:23 [W] What I was saying is before talk about what it means for Harbor DB and those snyk empowerus trios that compliant.
00:08:27 [W] those are capable so far in this picture we start with Docker on the left hand side or the dock distributions.
00:08:33 [W] be more specific and the doctor distribution is just essentially some content store.
00:08:38 [W] Storing your Docker images and so Harbor as a registry built around. Dr. Distribution is just some HTTP API back by that content store and so forth until very recently before the 2.0 the only artifacts that you can push to
00:08:53 [W] Our continued images.
00:09:04 [W] Yes, you can push some charts. But like we said earlier those are managed through try Museum separately from the images and they didn't get the same set of features like Tech retention technicality that containerd which is have and so oci open container initiative.
00:09:11 [W] Like take her tension tekton ability that containerd which is have and so oci open container initiative is a group that came along to Define specifications around form at runtime in distribution, so that the broader set of
00:09:20 [W] Action so that the broader set of planet of artifacts can get the same features as containerd images and I wanted to distribution to be able to deliver a registry.
00:09:30 [W] that is secure cross layered or layered and costs are accessible.
00:09:35 [W] And so it took the dock early 2.2 image spec as a starting point to create its own specifications around image format and its runtime and so what this picture is attempting to capture is little bit of that process or that history.
00:09:47 [W] We're both see I formalize these specs around image format image distribution, and that work was merged back into a dock description so that it fully
00:10:02 [W] It's a darker distribution in turn Harbor can now support hosting all these other Cloud native artifact that we've heard so much about in these conferences such as Helm charts seen app open policy agents Singularity.
00:10:18 [W] So the second icon here is supposed to be a clot on the scene a plus one is a cloud native application bundle. Another application deployment oriented artifacts worked on by guys over mocha soft.
00:10:31 [W] So being able to host dr.
00:10:46 [W] Manifest lists is one of the things that came out just support for oci the documentary Festival is something that has existed for a while, but was was previously on the unsupported in the harbor and the Manifest lists is essentially just a packaging of
00:10:54 [W] In this picture we start with the Manifest lists, which is it selfish on digest and it's acting as a pointer to all these other images.
00:11:05 [W] They're each bill for specific architecture.
00:11:11 [W] And so it's holding these together in some way and that's what allows you to use the same image name for all these different images Bill for different architectures.
00:11:19 [W] And so just try to keep this in the back of your head that there is this index structure called an Osa index and we'll come back to this later in the demo.
00:11:23 [W] So Docker Hub is actually a really good example of something that is O CI compliant and probably the first registry that's all second client and they can fully handled.
00:11:42 [W] Dr. Manifest lists.
00:11:46 [W] I'll just talk about in fact pretty much all the official images that you see on dr. Hook today are using the Manifest was allowing for multiple platforms to be supported using the same image name image tag combination
00:11:57 [W] here is the BusyBox image with tag latest and you'll see that it's referenced in multiple shot digests for different architectures when next you have the RM nips and you even have different variants of these architectures and so when
00:12:13 [W] For busy box from Docker Hub today, it will actually fetch the version of that image that matches your client.
00:12:26 [W] So unless your point specifically by digestive you pull by tag Docker Hub will responsibly fetch the right version of that image.
00:12:30 [W] And so that's the experience that we want to deliver with Harbor as well that users can push and pull manifest lists if we can manage these as a whole but also manage the images within individually and so that's also just one use of no say Index this
00:12:50 [W] Cheering image on Docker Hub that we just looked at but there are other artifacts that are leveraging this they're shown here.
00:13:00 [W] And so here we're looking at a project within Harbor when the kind of specific repository within that project and you can see that we have a containerd manage a Helm chart cloudevents fashion bundling and another Docker image on the same project
00:13:12 [W] Go on the left-hand side.
00:13:16 [W] So we put this here to solder draw a contrast with the one point X version Harbor where you only had containerd is nothing else.
00:13:23 [W] But now you have all these other parts that so you can manage in the same project.
00:13:27 [W] So that's really the biggest piece for the 2.0 release. Now the other work we did for 2.0 was replacing Claire image Scanner with trivy, which is another open source image scanner by a company called aqua security and
00:13:47 [W] My scanner and this is probably going back to the first version of Harbor but we started looking at other scanners because users have been asking us, you know, I've set up such and such scanner or pay for such and so scanner and can I get that to work with Harbor? And so you know
00:14:03 [W] One content version that we had done a lot of work to sort of open up those Partnerships with different every scanners through our lug bolt interrogation services framework, but this is sort of taking things one step further with regard to the embedded default image Harbor scanner.
00:14:19 [W] Simply we let it on trivia because it's simple as comprehensive. It's fast and it's accurate.
00:14:27 [W] It's also easier to set up. There's no need to manage and deviance and separately run some Dockers mode trivia also has a wider coverage for screening different operating systems and applications dependency managers a lot of which are listed here, but there are more and we found
00:14:41 [W] Superior in conducting deeper scans and capturing more vulnerabilities across all the different operating systems that we've tested including Debian Ubuntu Susie proton.
00:14:53 [W] So please check them out if you haven't and I believe they have some sessions that this conference as well.
00:14:58 [W] So that's 210 in a nutshell and I just wanted to spend a quick few minutes on the giving a preview of 2.1 upcoming release.
00:15:18 [W] And the first one I'll talk about is called proxy cash, which is the ability for Hardware to act as a pro through cash for another remote registry and we can call that registry to Target or the Upstream order to promote and so this is useful in situations where
00:15:27 [W] Docker notes that either have limited connectivity or no creativity to that Target registry and it could be any number of reasons or I could be security or compliance reasons. We could just be pure connectivity issues and
00:15:43 [W] And so Docker Hub is a really great example, and that was the case that was brought to us.
00:15:52 [W] That was the most often raised to us.
00:15:55 [W] Docker Hub is a registry of where your dr.
00:15:55 [W] Klein's from all the water attempting to pull images from if you're if you pull too fast or you pull too frequently and your connection gets throttling or you might even get I couldn't and so Harbor is a proxy cash is meant to address this very problem.
00:16:10 [W] And in this case, it means that Harbor will serve. So if you have a harbor deployed it was serviced the middleman tufin.
00:16:14 [W] All the images from the remote registry that you're trying to hit cash a locally and then serve it to you.
00:16:24 [W] And so it's much faster in minimizes traversals over the network and prevents you from getting a prevalent in a way to do this is to create a project in Harbor.
00:16:35 [W] It's if you're familiar with how you create guarding the harbor, it's the same process except there's an option to enable it as a proxy project which requires you to enter the Target registry and point and the credentials.
00:16:47 [W] So what you want to do a doctor for from that remote registry you can Institute dr.
00:16:50 [W] Cole from the policy project insert. So you won't have to modify your doctor Pokeman in your apartment first to hit that proxy cash and stick.
00:17:00 [W] Much detail you can guys can learn about this in the Deep dive.
00:17:19 [W] But essentially we're improving the garbage collection.
00:17:23 [W] So it's non-blocking so you can still push and pull and delete images while it's running.
00:17:27 [W] This is not the case right now at all because the registers put into read-only mode and then we also have an integration with PTP providers like Rupert cracking and Ali Baba dragonfly.
00:17:39 [W] So there's gonna be a way to sort of there's an action called preheating which moves the images from Harbor.
00:17:46 [W] To the PTP side where it can be geode distributed to hundreds or thousands of little more effective way efficient will utilizing their PT striction of himself.
00:17:57 [W] The last thing you know, that's that's the 2.1.
00:18:11 [W] It's coming out in the foggiest.
00:18:12 [W] Please give it a try and appreciate any feedback you have when it comes out just final word about the community. The community is doing really well. And we appreciate everyone's contribution whether it's reason requirements or fixing bugs submitting PRS or doing
00:18:26 [W] Which is attending the community meetings and attending this could be fun conference.
00:18:32 [W] for example, so we're at all point for 12.4 case stars and within 20 contributors and lots of companies are using Harbor or have Partnerships with us.
00:18:41 [W] All right.
00:18:45 [W] I'm let's even do the demo as I think we're at almost 20 minutes. So that's even
00:18:49 [W] Okay.
00:18:51 [W] Thank you. Socratic snuffs share my screen.
00:18:57 [W] I assume everyone can see my screen.
00:19:07 [W] So yeah, I will.
00:19:11 [W] Yeah, Alex insert reduced. So we have several major features giving interest of time. I'm going to demonstrate the two major features from $2 and 2.2.1.
00:19:33 [W] So in the first one is about the
00:19:36 [W] oh see I support we provided into the low so as that Alex introduced so for the to Allah, we have introduced a artifacts support with this feature. We can
00:19:52 [W] Managing the images and we can also manage him charts in a bundle and other formats which follow the oci distribution standard.
00:20:04 [W] first let's have a demo situation on the Manifest lists as we know manifested list is a feature that
00:20:18 [W] which can store all kinds of different architecture images for a single repo.
00:20:32 [W] So I will demo how to upload our manifest.
00:20:35 [W] In through those steps first.
00:20:45 [W] We need to create a manifest and Dover has provided a manifest command which allow you to create manifest and you need to supply safai the target URL as well as the
00:20:53 [W] Onto the Manifest lists.
00:20:59 [W] So here I have including two images. So when is
00:21:02 [W] For the AMD architecture images and other is for the actor images.
00:21:19 [W] So once we have creating manifest, we need to annotate those two separate images as different architecture.
00:21:30 [W] So once they send teaching Stone and we can install command in first push.
00:21:33 [W] to push to the harbor
00:21:52 [W] Yeah, so what's we have pushed to the harbor and we can check our UI look at?
00:22:17 [W] what's the UI functionality we have provided in Harbor.
00:22:21 [W] For the manufacturer. There is a folder icon. You can click in and say what the inside the Manifest images are. So
00:22:36 [W] yeah, as you can see the two images one is the architect and I the amd64 architecture.
00:22:47 [W] Yeah, so next I'm going to demo is that so with all sigh our tech support we can also upload the ham chart as you know in Harbor to Daleks. They are supporting user to upload.
00:23:11 [W] I'm tired and many have talked to the chat Museum.
00:23:17 [W] So enhance readers or experimental feature user can upload the habitats to the oci compatible richest and this is what I'm
00:23:26 [W] to demo
00:23:27 [W] So yeah as the command shows that every time you need to study this experiment whole tag before you run any hum commands for the
00:23:47 [W] the feature as I have just showed we have to um chats and I tacked before the demo so we can use Helm chatbots to put this to Harbor and watch once it is pushed
00:24:02 [W] And check on the UI.
00:24:06 [W] In Harbor portal and see the helm chart is uploaded and we have a hem icon also attached to with this artifact.
00:24:22 [W] So if user clicked into the some charred and we can see all the additional information in Stockton with how how much at this is the themes that we have provided in, Chattanooga. Mmm.
00:24:33 [W] Yeah, so in the same time you can also pull from Harbor about the helm chatter. You have a lot of loaded and this is just the demo this so.
00:24:53 [W] Yeah, so in the same time we are not removing chatter Museum feature because there's also existing harm to users who cannot upload charts to the outside Registries still
00:25:09 [W] so pool from Harbor about the Home tab you have a lot of loaded and this is just the demo this so
00:25:10 [W] Yeah, so in the same time we are not removing chatter Museum feature because there's also existing harm to users who cannot upload charts to the outside registry still consuming
00:25:12 [W] Them so they keep this feature in 2.0 and 2.1 and we hope that eventually we can remove this dependency and we can stall charts all using oats heritage.
00:25:23 [W] The third I want left to demo is that cloud native application bundle scenario.
00:25:37 [W] So as we know so we enclose knative word.
00:25:39 [W] It's not just images right?
00:25:48 [W] We have a chart we have also we have seen in Panda. We also have Opa pain though. We have other like llamo Rafael. We need to upload actually for the for the oci support and we can
00:25:54 [W] It's not just the images, right? We have a chart we have also we have seen in Panda. We also have Opa down though. We have other like llamo Rafael. We need to upload actually for the for the oci
00:25:57 [W] Those cloudevents facts this is demo that use the synapse to oci command to upload sin and Bondo to Harbor as we can see.
00:26:10 [W] This is the examples in and Bondo Json file.
00:26:15 [W] So once we have four
00:26:19 [W] do not upload and we can see from the UI.
00:26:27 [W] there are two.
00:26:28 [W] Two artifacts, we need instant bond or burial bloating as they can.
00:26:38 [W] say that for this in a icon and we can click in to this folder icon.
00:26:47 [W] We can say just one image uploaded and also there's file uploaded.
00:26:53 [W] Yeah, let's quickly go through the power of the oci formats.
00:27:06 [W] Is that so besides any official formats. We can also upload our top file or folder soon OS command line to manage your diff other are also artifacts here.
00:27:20 [W] I'm going to show you that it was to upload tar.
00:27:26 [W] You can simply use the last push giving touch it.
00:27:41 [W] URL and visited location, we are currently attached easy file and once you have uploaded and you can also use all of us.
00:27:56 [W] Yeah, I also upload a folder. So once we have love with you we can check the
00:28:05 [W] You are apart. Oh and we have above list artifact and we can also pull it down to our machine. So I'm just changing to different the root directory and
00:28:21 [W] Download the version and I will use Pokemon to pull the Tai Chi file.
00:28:29 [W] A defect as we can see so when you pull the hose artifact in Israel all us will automatically change the format you have uploaded before so you will get a folder and you will get a
00:28:45 [W] Okay, as attic smashing is so besides the pool and push. So there are other features like scanning replication and tank retention all those
00:29:04 [W] You can't work out very well with the new Jose artifacts.
00:29:12 [W] Yeah, I'm just showing the scanning works. So I think
00:29:20 [W] here is that let's move into the parks cache feature found improved process cash actually with solving two problems one problem.
00:29:36 [W] is that when you have isolated environment, probably you can use you just need to configure the harbor as your proxy to pull image from outside the yard isolated environment and then have a caching this pull the
00:29:49 [W] For the first future use so let me go directly to how the user can configure this so first.
00:29:58 [W] User need to create a registry and point. This reduced important is tell the tale Harbor where you would like to pull images from.
00:30:15 [W] For this demo.
00:30:19 [W] I'm currently choosing talker Harbor registration Point as you can see in the previous list via almost swatting as many replication, which is important countries support.
00:30:33 [W] As possible.
00:30:40 [W] So once you have configured this stalker Harbour Bridge is important whether you further need to do is that you need to create a policy cash project.
00:30:49 [W] create a project and what do you need to do is that you check this podcast feature and see you in the
00:30:57 [W] and point you have just conflict.
00:31:00 [W] T' and click, okay.
00:31:03 [W] Yeah, once once this is done and you can see a new project is created and you can change to the command line to push images.
00:31:20 [W] So here as you can see I I have yeah, I removing the previous download image and I will pour new images.
00:31:32 [W] So this parsec catch projects, so
00:31:35 [W] Yeah, beside right is I can also pull the my Seco.
00:31:50 [W] I can also pull hello word.
00:31:54 [W] New repository is catching Harbor in this podcast projects.
00:32:11 [W] Yeah, I think that's all my demo. We given into the time and for the other features we have introduced, please join our dip-tuck session.
00:32:28 [W] we will how you choose more about other features.
