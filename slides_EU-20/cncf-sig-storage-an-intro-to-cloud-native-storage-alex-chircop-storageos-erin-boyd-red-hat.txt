00:00:30 [W] Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to the intro to cncf 6 storage section.
00:00:36 [W] My name is Alex Kirk up and I'm the CEO of storage of s and the co-chair of the cncf Sig storage micro presenter is Aaron Boyd I work for red hat is mentioned.
00:00:45 [W] I'm also the co-chair for the cncf storage sync and sorry we're not able to join everyone in person, but we're glad that we can provide this introductory session so you can learn more about
00:00:55 [W] Out how to get involved or how to donate your project to the cncf.
00:00:58 [W] And so with that we're just going to go over.
00:01:07 [W] why do we have cigs? And the reason why cigs were were generally created was so that we could scale contributions to the cloud gate of computing Foundation where we have both a technical and
00:01:19 [W] unity and retaining the integrity and quality of the ones being committed to the cncf and their mission this allowed more people to be able to provide a due diligence and interface to many members of the community you
00:01:35 [W] Find more about the details of how the cigs were formed at the link on the second bullet.
00:01:41 [W] So what exactly are the objectives of the Sig it's meant to be created so that we can strengthen the project ecosystem.
00:01:55 [W] This means that we can find projects that aren't currently well represented within the cncf and Foster those into the environment by identifying those gaps in the portfolio and attracting
00:02:09 [W] Objects to fill those gaps.
00:02:13 [W] It's also meant to educate and inform users what different projects do where the gaps are and where we can grow the different Technologies were meant to be unbiased effective and provide practical information to our user Community
00:02:25 [W] It also the cigs also help focus our attention resources to fostering project maturity.
00:02:40 [W] So while met a new project may join at a Sandbox level we can help them grow into incubation and hopefully graduation as the project moves through the process.
00:02:42 [W] The cncf Sig also helps us clarify the relationship between projects because there are many different six within the cncf.
00:03:02 [W] This allows us to cross communicate between different pieces of the technology where we may have a very storage for cast project. It also has aspects of perhaps security.
00:03:11 [W] So this allows us to talk with other experts within that field and communicate and understand how the project fits.
00:03:16 [W] Across all of these different pillars. It also allows us to engage more communities into on-ramp. So we have an effective communication to the technical oversight committee.
00:03:32 [W] It also helps to reduce the workload to the TOC while retaining control and integrity within that body. The cigs are Ventura vendor neutral.
00:03:39 [W] So with our responsibilities we start off with handling the project by understanding what the project does by documenting a high level road map within the space and identifying the gaps within the project landscape again. The project
00:03:58 [W] You can be found on the cncf website that projects that fall within that we then go through and perform health checks. Is that a vibrant project?
00:04:08 [W] Is it growing?
00:04:13 [W] Does it have a wide base of community or is it a new project? That's looking to find new members.
00:04:16 [W] are all questions that we ask ourselves when we're looking at a new project then we perform a discovery and we reach out to different candidate projects and talk about
00:04:23 [W] what they would like to accomplish by becoming part of the cncf and then proceeded to help them prepare for a presentation to the TOC.
00:04:35 [W] Every project will be assigned to one suitable Sig by the TOC.
00:04:40 [W] It may start within one Sig and then find that it's better suited by a different Sig within the cncf.
00:04:43 [W] Our interaction is just meant to Foster the best way for projects to find their way through this process.
00:04:51 [W] You can see here a process Flow by how most projects are engaged and go through the process.
00:05:02 [W] So as you open a GitHub PR the TOC does a brief triage to understand whether or not there's a gap in the landscape in this project is a good fit and then proceeds to do
00:05:14 [W] Presentation this presentation is then recorded so that it can be passed on to the TOC and they can watch it when they have time for this allows the TOC to scale much more effectively rather than having rigid meetings the TOC then
00:05:29 [W] Views a recommendation that the Sig creates and then decides whether or not the project is appropriate and goes forward through incubation sponsorship. And with that the TOC member is then assigned
00:05:45 [W] To do a due diligence the due diligence consists of looking at the technology the governance and talking to different people in the community to understand more about the projects.
00:06:00 [W] Once the due diligence is done. Then the project goes up for public comment. And then the TOC vote if the vote is confirmed. The project is accepted into incubation.
00:06:10 [W] Another one of our responsibilities within the Sig is end user education.
00:06:25 [W] We aim to provide up-to-date high quality and unbiased easy to understand material this in that how do we choose to use a technology within our workflow and
00:06:35 [W] These different cognitive Technologies when it comes to storage.
00:06:40 [W] What are the best practices some of the things that we've created to help users facilitate doing this are white papers presentations videos and other forms of training to talk about to clarify the Technologies to compare different
00:06:54 [W] Again, since we're vendor-neutral we tend not to focus on one or the other but what is the best way to go about it given your particular application or workload?
00:07:07 [W] We also talked about different Trends provide illustrative successes and failures and provide as much research and fact as we can and provide that to our users in the community to De kind of dispel any of maybe the
00:07:20 [W] relation around these different Technologies
00:07:24 [W] And lastly we look to the community to understand what their needs are part of this is gathering input from them.
00:07:40 [W] What are their expectations when they're looking to the cncf storage sync.
00:07:46 [W] What information do they expect to learn and glean from us?
00:07:49 [W] What are the pain points that they're having when they're integrating persistent storage into their environment?
00:07:54 [W] What are some of their use cases?
00:07:57 [W] This is all very useful feedback and helps us formulate our lens.
00:07:58 [W] Two projects that we're looking for and identify the gaps.
00:08:11 [W] We also try to compile into consumable reports and presentations to its to address many of these pain points or designs or best practices.
00:08:13 [W] And lastly we look to engage within the community.
00:08:22 [W] we're open we have meetings bimonthly along with agendas and notes and mailing lists and any other communication we look to the community to help guide how we proceed with different projects and
00:08:36 [W] rest many of these pain points or designs or best practices
00:08:37 [W] And lastly we look to engage within the community.
00:08:38 [W] we're open we have meetings bimonthly along with agendas and notes and mailing lists and any other communication we look to the community to help guide how we proceed with different projects and
00:08:40 [W] Trends and you can find our meeting on the cncf Sig meeting calendar and communication to the Sig documents is openly published and maintained on a regular basis.
00:08:49 [W] And lastly the Sig responsibilities are meant to be the trusted advisors to the TOC since the TOC is a very limited number of people sometimes different Technologies are maybe not fully
00:09:08 [W] By the TOC, so this is meant to expand on their experience as an SME.
00:09:20 [W] We're to assist in performing the technical due diligence given that we're subject matter experts in those areas on both new and graduating projects and advise the TOC on our findings and be involved or periodically check in on those projects.
00:09:29 [W] Schedule yearly reviews to look at how a projects health is doing and to help them proceed to going to the next level.
00:09:37 [W] And with that I'm going to go ahead and hand it over to Alex.
00:09:46 [W] Thanks, sir.
00:09:54 [W] So a little bit now about some of the work that we're we've been doing in Sig storage.
00:10:00 [W] So sick storage was founded in keep gone back in Barcelona and it was one of the first things that was put together the reason the reason why we think you know storageos
00:10:12 [W] Important to consider when we're looking at the overall Cloud native landscape is because you know contrary to popular belief there is no such thing as a stateless architecture all applications need to store State somewhere
00:10:28 [W] You know what? We're looking to cover in the storage Sig are the types of applications and Cloud native projects that enable applications due to store States whether it's in
00:10:43 [W] so our Solutions over or Services because at the end of the day in much the same way that you know containers provides the capability to make your applications portable and orchestrators, like kubernative provide the ability to
00:10:59 [W] Alan to abstract away the infrastructure the storage needs to faith into that into that mesh to and therefore interoperating with storage greatly increases the number of use cases and the number and broadens
00:11:15 [W] Of applications that can live in this In This Cloud native environment.
00:11:26 [W] So so specifically, you know as Aaron mentioned we're here to we're here to work together with with the community with with the TOC and the front end users and projects and
00:11:36 [W] Two groups to ensure that there is a healthy set of storage projects to make up the two to contributes to the cncf.
00:11:48 [W] when we talk about when we talk about storage, it's very important to understand the scope because we're not only talking about storage systems that relates to for example a more traditional volume,
00:12:05 [W] I'm trying to stand the scope because we're not only talking about storage systems that relates to for example a more traditional volume, even though that's the most mature set of
00:12:10 [W] Mature set of products that are available in kubernative today, but we're actually talking about anyway of persisting data and persisting storage. So that's that could include traditional
00:12:21 [W] So that's that could include traditional systems like block stores and file systems or object stores, for example, but also things like databases and key value stores and other ways of of caching and distributing images.
00:12:33 [W] Which is the other thing that's very important.
00:12:38 [W] Is that what we've seen more than ever before is that developers are getting involved in the decision-making process for for picking their storage and clearly not not
00:12:51 [W] For for picking their storage.
00:12:52 [W] I'm clearly not not every store solution is going to be suitable for every use case.
00:13:03 [W] So it's whatever before it's important to understand the different attributes of other storage system like availability and scalability performance durability consistency and with trying to cover that
00:13:10 [W] Like availability and scalability performance durability consistency and with trying to cover that in detail in to give end users the ability to understand the requirements and to therefore choose the appropriate
00:13:16 [W] there's the ability to understand the requirements and therefore choose the appropriate Source systems for therefore the use cases in the storage landscape white paper which which we recently published the version 2 of this
00:13:26 [W] Is being an ongoing I don't going project that that we've we've been keeping up to date as things advance.
00:13:35 [W] The sink itself is made up of a number of coaches. And the number of tech leads and is an and Toc liaison for the Sig is she angry who's a Toc member and he's also
00:13:52 [W] Contributor to the to the end and the whole and altar of ci/cd project.
00:14:02 [W] So we've got we've got a healthy mix of different sets of expertise and we're always looking for additional tech leads.
00:14:13 [W] So if you think that that you can help with the Sig and work with projects and evaluating or contributing to the documents that we're providing, please let yourself be known. We always welcome needs athletes.
00:14:22 [W] Some of the specific groups that we also interact with to which have a strong storage influence our the obviously the kubernative storage sync. In fact a number of the tech
00:14:39 [W] And coaches are also members of the of the storage group in Athey storage Sig similarly the CSI project which is which is an interface that allows grouping eighties to to interface
00:14:55 [W] With a number of different storage providers again.
00:15:03 [W] We have a number of tech leads who are also in the CSI project.
00:15:09 [W] The security Sig is as as Aaron mentioned is I think that we work with for security issues related to storage projects similarly the apps eggs.
00:15:18 [W] And the service catalog cigs?
00:15:21 [W] A little bit of some of the stuff we've been working on since the last coupon. So we've been helping the TOC review a number of new or existing projects and the the
00:15:39 [W] Mine's only for new projects. Sometimes we are reviewing projects that are going through a graduation process.
00:15:55 [W] So moving from say a Sandbox to incubation or an incubation stage to to graduation.
00:15:58 [W] We've also created some surveys to help with prioritizing prioritizing the work that we're doing and we've been updating the documents that
00:16:10 [W] we've published in the past. So for example, we've recently published the version 2 of the storage landscape white paper, which has new database sections and updated management interfaces for cgroup focusing on CSI.
00:16:25 [W] Working on a number of documents for for Community use cases, and we've also drafted a white paper focusing on performance and benchmarking with in storage
00:16:41 [W] Being a wide variety of docket of projects that have presented to the sake of the presentations are really useful because they're they're they're helpful to understand the project. It gets better Community
00:16:57 [W] Why then is the the scope of the project and and obviously if the project is going through a cncf review those recordings and and the and the QA process that typically follows these interactive sessions
00:17:13 [W] Review those recordings and and the and the QA process that typically follows these interactive sessions provides the critical information to help with due diligence requests as well as to
00:17:20 [W] Critical information to help with due diligence requests as well as to provide a backdrop for the TOC to make their voting decisions.
00:17:24 [W] Some of the cncf storage projects that are out there today include some very mature projects like Rick and vitess that that's our that are graduated or graduating now projects like
00:17:41 [W] similarly projects like tikv, which is a key value store is currently also in graduating votes it CD which is of course very well known and cord too many kubernative projects
00:17:57 [W] Another projects like openfaas Longhorn and try to tribe OSS.
00:18:07 [W] That's our that's our sign books projects.
00:18:12 [W] And then finally we also worked on projects like like dragonfly which is an image distribution project for things like container images, which recently got reviewed and go Primitives to to
00:18:22 [W] I'd like to I'd like to focus just a little bit on the storage landscape white paper. This discovers a number of different things as we mentioned, you know, we want to give end users and developers the ability to
00:18:40 [W] The attributes of a storage system and also to understand the different layers within a storage system and how they impact the the different attributes and how they work.
00:18:57 [W] And then finally we're also trying to focus. We also provide a lot of information to talk about how data is accessed in different storage systems covering boats
00:19:07 [W] All the volumes.
00:19:18 [W] So for example block stores file systems distributed file systems and the like as well as storage systems that are accessed through application Level apis like databases and an object stores and key value stores, for example, and finally we also
00:19:25 [W] Apis, like databases and objects tours and key value stores, for example, and finally, we also cover a number of aspects of management interfaces and how orchestrators can dynamically provisioned storage
00:19:34 [W] Faces and how orchestrator is can dynamically provisioned storage in these in these sorts of systems.
00:19:36 [W] The reason why it's important to to understand the storage attributes is because they help to Define what's needed out of the storage environment based on the attributes that are required by the
00:19:52 [W] The application so so we've classified five different attributes availability scalability performs consistency and durability.
00:20:06 [W] And those are actually measured across a number of a number of different metrics.
00:20:15 [W] So for example, availability can cover things from the ability of a story system to fail over or to move data across nodes as well as data protection and redundancy capabilities.
00:20:21 [W] Again, scalability can be measured through a number of different options often through the number of operations or the number of true. But but but sometimes also the number of clients that they support and similarly performance can be can be measured with
00:20:36 [W] See capabilities again scalability can be measured through a number of different options often through the number of operations or the number of true. But but but sometimes also the number of clients that they support and similarly performance can be
00:20:38 [W] It's parameters such as latency operation. So it's Rupert's one thing to consider here is that that often there are compromises to be maids and it's not possible to hit High
00:20:52 [W] These metrics so, you know High availability can can sometimes come across the scalability or performance consump times effects consistency and or vice versa and therefore
00:21:08 [W] is requirements is really really important as we look at the different layers in a storage system and it's particularly important now to understand the neckline knative world what those different layers are and which
00:21:23 [W] Finding things like the performance you require or the availability for example of the scalability, you know, we have different different topologies and different virtualization that that happens at different layers
00:21:39 [W] The the top of the stack with the orchestrator and container namespaces and an operating system volume managers, for example all the way down to different
00:21:55 [W] Or virtualization based metrics that actually persist data to a non-volatile layer.
00:22:08 [W] And what's particularly important is is to understand that the way that you access the storage from your operating system from your application doesn't necessarily Define
00:22:18 [W] That's for boots of that story system.
00:22:23 [W] So, you know, we sometimes think of you know, broad generalizations like file systems are excellent for throughput or block based devices might be excellent for low latency.
00:22:37 [W] But in reality is we have to understand how those systems are being provided in terms of the overall solution because often block devices can sit on Object Store back ends and file systems
00:22:53 [W] It sits on one object store back ends. And therefore they share some of the attributes of those underlying back ends to provides those those environments and in fact because of all of this
00:23:09 [W] Of this all of these different layers, one of the one of the things we're trying to work on at the moment is document a new white paper to try and Define the concepts for measuring performance in things like volumes
00:23:25 [W] we're putting in bit of work to Define things like terminology and some of the concepts and and trying to Define common pitfalls and and and and issues that that people come across on a common basis
00:23:41 [W] You thing here is to give people the tools to to make their own comparisons.
00:23:49 [W] It's very hard.
00:23:50 [W] In fact, it's almost pointless to try and compare published results from different vendors or different projects without a deep understanding of how the test is run and how it applies to your application.
00:24:04 [W] So long story short.
00:24:06 [W] I always try and run your own tests. And the good news is that with you know systems like kubenetes. It's
00:24:12 [W] it's possible to make self-service declarative tests fairly straightforward to so this is a paper that we working on now and at we hope to publish in the next few months as Aaron mentioned
00:24:27 [W] Is done publicly all of our meetings are public re meets twice a month on the second and fourth Wednesday. The zoom coals are open the the repo containing the work that we do and the meeting minutes are also open
00:24:43 [W] This is recorded which is particularly useful to go back and be able to watch Project presentations.
00:24:52 [W] For example, if you wanted to join the sick and easiest thing to do is to join the mailing list and hop onto the on to the next call. We would be happy to welcome you.
00:25:04 [W] specifically as I mentioned before we're looking we're always looking for for tech leads to help work on a project reviews and and and whether the new projects or reviewing the health of existing projects, and we're also like help
00:25:20 [W] Like the performance white paper.
00:25:23 [W] I'm so again, please do join and we'd love to have you the the Sig is made up of over 30 representatives from different vendors. And as well as a number of independent developers and community members.
00:25:38 [W] And that takes us to the end. So thank you for joining us on this introduction to the cncf Sig storage and and would be happy to take your questions and and do some Q&A.
00:25:54 [W] so
00:26:04 [W] Welcome everyone and thank you for joining welcome everyone and thank you for joining our session. We're happy to see you all here.
00:26:20 [W] Both of us are available to to answer questions.
00:26:21 [W] That's that you might have. So please feel free to QA into the into the box on your left.
00:26:29 [W] So I see a question in here Alex about where do we get the details of all the projects that are under the purview of the Sig and their current state?
00:26:40 [W] So sorry Aaron you you can not go ahead.
00:26:51 [W] I was just going to see if there's anyone I was I was going to say I could start would be to look at the sake of repo all of the all the projects are listed there.
00:27:04 [W] Alex about where do we get the details of all the projects that are under the purview of the Sig and their current state?
00:27:06 [W] So sorry Aaron, you can no go ahead.
00:27:07 [W] I was just scrolling to see if there's anyone I was I was going to say I could start would be to look at the sake of repo all of the all of the projects are listed there.
00:27:09 [W] We also have all of the projects which are under the purview of the cncf are under the TOC repo and they're also listed on the cncf website.
00:27:20 [W] Of course, the the projects that that we evaluate and that we're that were looking at are covered in our six sessions.
00:27:33 [W] feel free to be there join those sessions and contribute and and ask
00:27:35 [W] Questions and participate in the projects or all of the sessions are also recorded So it's it's a good idea to have a look at those recordings to see perhaps past project
00:27:50 [W] And even if all of those methods fail for you, please feel free to send a message to the Sig storage building list.
00:28:04 [W] We monitor it daily happy to respond if you're unable to find status or don't get your questions answered by any of those methods.
00:28:11 [W] All right.
00:28:16 [W] Awesome.
00:28:20 [W] We also have another question here about container attached storage.
00:28:31 [W] And the question goes while CSI seems to be an established term of not found Caz in the storage and scape white paper.
00:28:35 [W] Of course.
00:28:37 [W] Yeah, the the landscape white paper is actually a Google doc and it's it is open for comments. And we do review it from time to time the the concept of
00:28:51 [W] Container attached storage.
00:28:54 [W] I'm not entirely sure it's it's it's a well-known terminology that people necessarily search for older.
00:29:08 [W] It might certainly becoming that and we do with docked the white paper as as as things as things progress over time.
00:29:11 [W] When take the next one. So Allah row says is the Sig storage only interested or concerned about cncf projects or its activity may also extend the other open source projects related to sick interests.
00:29:28 [W] So I think the Sig is open to discussing projects that haven't yet been accepted.
00:29:39 [W] I mean that's it's part of our process is understanding the ecosystem.
00:29:42 [W] Projects that aren't currently in the cncf but maybe want to join and part of that would be discussing any storage related interests use cases.
00:29:53 [W] that's certainly part of it. We just ask that you get some time on the agenda and we can discuss it and talk about the viability or how maybe it fits into the white paper.
00:30:08 [W] I think we're certainly open to those discussions.
00:30:09 [W] It helps us better understand what the community needs are.
00:30:12 [W] And you can address them accordingly.
00:30:15 [W] Yeah, definitely. I think I think the project presentations are some of the most informative and useful sessions on the sake and one of the things that we're always on the lookout for is to identify
00:30:31 [W] Potential gaps in the landscape, of course, the cncf projects covering storage are are are quite broad. We have we have sections covering, you know
00:30:46 [W] Everything from distributed file systems to block stores and and also things like key value stores, but of course, you know, we're always looking for the next project that
00:31:01 [W] Join the community.
00:31:02 [W] and the next one from Owen says I'm particularly interested in security topics in relation to persistent storage particularly coming from a traditional non-cloud knative background into the world of k8s, I think both
00:31:19 [W] Alex and I touched on this in that you know, though the Sig's are focused on one particular area cars being storage and there's a separate Sig for security.
00:31:32 [W] We certainly don't operate in a vacuum.
00:31:34 [W] I think there are a lot of security concerns that we look at when we talk about each project and as discussed also within you know, some of the use cases and white papers, so we'd love to hear some of your thoughts if you are working on a
00:31:49 [W] Project that is looking through this or have any questions Alex if you want to add anything to that piece.
00:31:57 [W] Yeah, I mean when when projects are go through graduation specifically that that involves a security audit, so that's part of the process that said it's probably worth
00:32:14 [W] Everything that you know, a lot of storage providers that at work with the CSI standards also have Integrations to the the kubernetes security model and volumes.
00:32:29 [W] That supports things like, you know namespaces and Iraq Etc. So so you may find that that the security requirements are catered For by virtue of the CSI integration.
00:32:43 [W] And then we ran wanted to know can you point more about use cases and types of storage that may suit a concrete case?
00:32:58 [W] So Alex and I are both smiling kind of struggling. So we had an attempt to try to do specific use cases that we would flush out and show how we would set it up
00:33:08 [W] We would do best practices. The problem we ran into though is we're very dedicated to this being a vendrell vendor neutral space and by providing very concrete use cases with specific.
00:33:23 [W] Knowledge he's we felt that bias crept in selecting one of the other so we've decided to kind of table that specific approach and try to come up with something that will allow users to make
00:33:38 [W] smart decisions and maybe that's going with the anti patterns of what not to do and where not to use things, but we're certainly open to suggestions to what would best fit the user Community, but
00:33:51 [W] You know.
00:33:52 [W] All right, I guess I'd love to hear feedback of what people are looking for from the Sig as far as concrete.
00:34:02 [W] Use cases are concerned.
00:34:03 [W] That would be helpful. Even if it's just patterns of usage. That would be helpful for us to be able to articulate that better.
00:34:10 [W] Yeah, one of the one of the things that's that we've tried to capture in the white paper at a more sort of the broader level was we trying to give end users
00:34:26 [W] the information they would needs to understand I guess the different attributes of their application and then how that translated to the different storage systems and you know, there are there for some
00:34:42 [W] Samples in their of you know different different characteristics of different storage systems based on you know, things like latency or consistency or things like that
00:34:56 [W] that's it, you know is there and said we have a fairly strict rule about not being King making within within the Sig and therefore providing more detailed use cases for you know, say a specific database or a specific storage product would be
00:35:12 [W] With the holidays without without suffering some sort of bias, but we do but we are potentially looking at the option of providing some use cases for cncf project specifically.
00:35:28 [W] so, you know, perhaps projects like Prometheus or at CD as an example.
00:35:29 [W] The next question is around.
00:35:36 [W] Did you work with vmfs plug-in to k8s.
00:35:40 [W] there's some problems for the VMS when they're shut down that the VM stay locked until it started to you know about this problem.
00:35:49 [W] Is there a road map to fix it?
00:35:52 [W] I can't speak in particular to this particular bug and we don't
00:35:54 [W] Necessarily look at k8s at that level within the Sig.
00:36:01 [W] I don't know Alex you have any experience around and can comment on that?
00:36:05 [W] No, I'm sorry.
00:36:09 [W] not in there over my expertise either I would encourage you so I go ahead.
00:36:20 [W] I was just going to say that that might be a better question for the kubernative 6 storage per haps.
00:36:21 [W] Yep.
00:36:23 [W] I was going to say the exact same thing.
00:36:33 [W] So they typically meet bimonthly on Thursday. You can also find if you go to the Google Groups for kubernative should be able to find that on that particular calendar.
00:36:35 [W] Horse also send it to their mailing list.
00:36:43 [W] They might be able to provide you better status around that and if there isn't a bug, please open an issue around this.
00:36:46 [W] These so on that on that note.
00:36:55 [W] We're we're at time. So I'll just quickly wrap this up by saying we're always super Keen to have new members join the sake of so, please if you consider joining one of the Sig
00:37:08 [W] Walls and maybe Fallen tearing to help with the documents that we provide or to volunteer to become a tech leads and and help with project reviews.
00:37:23 [W] We're always super keen on having new members join.
00:37:24 [W] Yes.
00:37:27 [W] Thanks for attending. If you have any other questions we weren't able to answer.
00:37:33 [W] Please see us within the slack Channel and we'd be happy to answer your questions there.
00:37:34 [W] Putting some thanks everyone.
00:37:38 [W] Thank you.
