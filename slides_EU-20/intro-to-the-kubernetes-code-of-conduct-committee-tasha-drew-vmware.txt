00:00:06 [W] Hi everybody.
00:00:07 [W] This is Tasha Drew. And I'm here to go over the intro to the code of conduct committee. As a member of the code of conduct committee. We realized a lot of people don't know that kubernative has the code of conduct committee.
00:00:17 [W] We do put the code of conduct front and center in everything that the community does and ask everybody to abide by it. Read it understand it as they're participating in the community, but
00:00:32 [W] It we realized a lot of people don't realize there is a group of people who work on enforcing the code of conduct and providing basic steering of how the code of conduct is applied.
00:00:46 [W] So we thought it would make a lot of sense for us to just say hello to the community kind of let you know what we're up to. And also where you can get more resources for kind of understanding the code of conduct and the kubernative community.
00:00:59 [W] So what is the code of conduct at a high level and I did include the link here for everyone who wants to go and read the whole thing just as a note the code of conduct that we have adopted as part of the kubernative community is
00:01:16 [W] Upstream and open source from the most widely accepted code of conduct framework in the technology industry, which is the contributor Covenant and I would really encourage people to check out that project as well.
00:01:31 [W] The code of conduct is deliberately not a comprehensive set of laws with sort of rigorous framework of what you should and shouldn't do.
00:01:43 [W] It's more of a set of behavior that all members of the kubernative community agree to abide.
00:01:45 [W] Bye in order to make the Upstream Community a professional and safe environment for a diverse population of individuals.
00:01:59 [W] So as I've really large open source Community, we have a diverse range of individuals and we want to make sure that we have a safe and professional environment that those people can do their best
00:02:08 [W] To work in and that's really what we're focused on as a code of conduct committee. And as a community the members of the code of conduct committee are elected by the steering committee, but we are independent of the steering committee
00:02:23 [W] End of the cncf end of the Linux foundation and things are structured in that way to make sure that the code of conduct committee is not beholden to political or company pressure so we can really act in service to the community itself
00:02:38 [W] In ensuring that the community remains a safe and professional environment for people to code in and contribute to the Upstream community.
00:02:48 [W] So why do we have a code of conduct at the end of the day?
00:02:59 [W] It's very difficult for people to understand what framework they're being asked to behave as part of if we don't document it.
00:03:12 [W] So just in the same way that we document how to submit a pull request or how to appropriately test some code that you want contributed to the Upstream Community.
00:03:19 [W] We did the same thing with the code of conduct so you can go you can read it. You can try and understand like what are we really saying that we want to
00:03:22 [W] You when we say that kubernative should be a safe and professional environment for people to contribute in and we and in it by having a code of conduct.
00:03:33 [W] What we're doing is we're setting clear expectations of acceptable behavior.
00:03:39 [W] Our goals is a community community are to be welcoming inclusive and professional a lot of people who work on kubernative Zar doing so either to advance their day job or as
00:03:50 [W] Out of their day job.
00:03:53 [W] And so we need to make sure that people can really do the work that they need to get done and have the impact that they need to make in order to be successful professionally in a professional and safe environment.
00:04:06 [W] So what does the committee do the committee obviously does meet privately since a lot of the things that we end up discussing a pretty sensitive Revolt often regarding interpersonal disputes.
00:04:24 [W] And so what we're really looking to do when we are enforcing the code of conduct is a set of behaviors. We triage anything that gets submitted to us.
00:04:38 [W] So somebody submits a complaint.
00:04:38 [W] Have the triage process we want to make sure that we are very responsive And Timely in our response to any issues that are arising in the community because a lot of times just having a timely response. Lets people know that we're here we care
00:04:53 [W] and then from that triage process we're really looking to do a couple different things when there is an interpersonal conflict or disputes a lot of times what we're looking to do is coach so
00:05:09 [W] Sometimes somebody may have crossed the line that they weren't even thinking about or they may not understand another person's perspective.
00:05:22 [W] So in a lot of ways, we're just looking to see what can we do to repair this in order to ensure that everyone's behaving professionally in the people really have the opportunity to learn and grow from any interactions that might be
00:05:32 [W] Thing in people not feeling that they can do their best work as part of the code of conduct committee.
00:05:40 [W] So sometimes we are coaching.
00:05:44 [W] We also exhaustively research any of the complaints that are filed. So we will look at GitHub GitHub interactions and things that involve the project directly to see is there a pattern of the behavior that's
00:05:55 [W] Reported and then that also gives us concrete examples that we can use as we are coaching people in how they may need to amend their behavior in order to really make sure that the kubernative community is a safe and
00:06:11 [W] National Space for everybody.
00:06:15 [W] We also can get involved in mediation.
00:06:24 [W] So sometimes there may be an issue that arises that may stem from something outside of the real purview of the code of conduct committee.
00:06:26 [W] For example, some sort of governance issue that then leads to some sort of interpersonal conflict because people are feeling or having feelings about what may have occurred and so we do have a mediation capability. So if people
00:06:39 [W] Or having a difficult time working together if it was that your day job.
00:06:47 [W] you could have your boss has come in and have some sort of professional mediation.
00:06:49 [W] We don't really think of it as professional mediation, but that's really what's happening. When your boss it's you and someone else down and it's like how do we work together?
00:06:56 [W] So since this is an open source Community we have to think about.
00:06:59 [W] Okay, how do we provide mediation between two people who may or may not work together? And so that is a lever that we can pull so if people need help overcoming interpersonal
00:07:12 [W] Licked we have this mediation capability that we can provide and another thing that we do is we do enforce boundaries.
00:07:24 [W] So if somebody has a continual pattern of behavior that is harmful to other people or if somebody has really done something egregious on various scales of egregiousness
00:07:31 [W] We can enforce boundaries and that may be explaining to the person that they are not going to be permitted to participate in the kubernative community for a time for a bounded period of time just to sort of reflect the
00:07:46 [W] business of their actions or it could be a permanent ban, but obviously if we were to take those actions, it would be done in a very serious and thoughtful manner with consideration for how it impacts all parties, but at the end of the
00:08:01 [W] What we're looking to do is a code of conduct committee is create is do our part in enforcing boundaries so that we're creating a professional space in which community members can be productive and people can't do their best work if they feel that
00:08:17 [W] Constantly under threat or being attacked and so in that way we do have different levers to pull if we need to in moving people out of the community who are making it unsafe for others.
00:08:32 [W] So why do we have a code of committee code of conduct committee at all?
00:08:40 [W] And the reason is the the role of the code of conduct committee is in its simplest form to enforce the code of conduct.
00:08:49 [W] We have a code of conduct.
00:08:52 [W] cncf itself also has a code of conduct and we share the same code of conduct but we because the code the kubernative community is so large. We need a dedicated committee to really make sure that
00:09:02 [W] everything is being enforced that issues are being heard that people are responded to because if we don't have people actively Staffing this role, we're sending a false message of safety to people who may be joining us
00:09:17 [W] Thing that people are are keep tracking to the these Professional Standards that we have communicated through our code of conduct.
00:09:32 [W] So having an unenforced code of conduct can send a false message of safety to marginalized people.
00:09:36 [W] And so it's important when you do adopt a code of conduct that you are also committing to having people staff that code of conduct enforced that code of conduct and to be an Avenue for people who are under threat to
00:09:49 [W] You use in order to make sure that they can be active in a professionally behaving environment and that they can do their best work in.
00:09:57 [W] There are a lot of myths around code of conduct.
00:10:08 [W] And so I thought I would just address some of those kind of for fun.
00:10:09 [W] I would like to give all of the credit to these to these fa Q's to the contributor comment Covenant which you can check out at their website contributor - covenants artwork, but they really compiled a list of questions of things that people are
00:10:23 [W] Sometimes afraid of when they hear of code of conduct committees or code of conduct and open source.
00:10:32 [W] So they have a bunch of really great questions and very thoughtful answers and I've borrowed some of those but if you'd like to see like a full list of things you may be wondering about I would really recommend their website and I did include the link to their website at the end of this deck,
00:10:43 [W] but one question is, you know doesn't the code of conduct just promotes political correctness, and the answer to that is political correctness has a very loaded term, but if you do
00:10:58 [W] Find political correctness as the belief that women non-binary people gay lesbian queer and or transgender people people of color and people of different religious backgrounds should be afforded the same rights and privileges as
00:11:13 [W] What else if you define it that way then?
00:11:18 [W] Yes the code of conduct.
00:11:20 [W] It does promote political correctness.
00:11:22 [W] However, I think at the end of the day everyone knows that promoting equality promoting a safe space where all of the different people who have a lot of value to bring to the kubernative community is the right thing to do and we're
00:11:35 [W] We not here to push any sort of political agenda.
00:11:39 [W] One question that I thought was really interesting that people asked a lot is about power to project maintainers. And I think this is a really good thing to kind of dive into because people often ask doesn't a code of conduct to give too much power to project maintainers
00:11:55 [W] And the answer to this you can cut is kind of like unfeeling an onion but has a bunch of layers up the project maintainers usually have a lot of power in open source communities regardless because they have the ability to accept pull
00:12:11 [W] Stan I pull requests and so they're The Gatekeepers to the to the technical aspects of the community and so they're already pretty powerful.
00:12:22 [W] They're already very connected having a code of conduct and a code of conduct committee actually starts to put breaks around the amount of power those people have around how other people are treated so, you know
00:12:36 [W] Project maintainers are the arbitrator arbitrators of code.
00:12:42 [W] and so our code and they are also the unquestioned leaders of the projects. They own if you don't have a code of conduct a maintainer has the power to eject anyone for any reason or no reason.
00:12:54 [W] Maybe they just don't like you.
00:13:05 [W] However, when you have a codified code of conduct then maintain them people who want to contribute do have an Avenue to ask to be treated in a respectful way.
00:13:08 [W] If they're not being treated in a respectful way and it also gives maintainers a sort of framework for looking at to make sure that they themselves are behaving in accordance with their stated values which are documented in the code of conduct.
00:13:21 [W] one way to think about this is that if you are a maintainer of a really popular open source platform, like kubernative use you have a lot of power and you also are probably pretty busy
00:13:37 [W] And you have a day job and you're doing 17 different things at once. And so you may not realize that sometimes a Brusque or no answer to sincere questions can really
00:13:52 [W] Um harm people as they attempt to interact with your project who don't have the context that you do or are just looking for something that may not be top of your priority list.
00:14:07 [W] And so in those interactions having a code of conduct committee that can come in and say Hey, you know, like let's look at the overall holistic behavior on these provide little coaching provide a little mentorship can actually be very valuable and improve the experience
00:14:17 [W] For both the maintainers and the contributors just because we all get sort of focused on our day-to-day activities and may miss the fact that we're starting to get into a pattern of behavior due to just being overwhelmed or whatever.
00:14:32 [W] That is actually not healthy for the community.
00:14:38 [W] So think of the code of conduct Committee in the fact that we are independent and that we stand apart from the overall steering committee as really a strength because it means that we can have perspective on both the maintainers and the contributors.
00:14:50 [W] And also provide coaching where needed when we regard list of how powerful the person in question is Let's see. We also have a question the code of conduct explicitly lists a set of protected classes.
00:15:05 [W] Does that make it acceptable to discriminate or make others feel unwelcome if they are not in a protected class and the answer to this is absolutely not the contributor Covenant and the kubernative code of conduct explicitly
00:15:20 [W] Protected classes for many reasons such as reminding people to give them appropriate consideration and assuring people in those classes that they are welcome in our community, which they absolutely are.
00:15:34 [W] However, it is not an invitation for people to seek loopholes or to discriminate against people who are not explicitly listed or make them feel unwelcome based on other criteria.
00:15:44 [W] That's not listed in the code of conduct there is of course the caveat that those who discriminate or make others
00:15:50 [W] Feel unwelcome are themselves not welcome in our community.
00:15:54 [W] We do have some questions about people so people are always worried.
00:16:09 [W] Oh what if I get reported to the code of conduct committee, and I would say, you know always enter into interactions with good intent and with empathy and this is very unlikely going to be an issue for you.
00:16:15 [W] However, if you just just to kind of identify that people do get worried.
00:16:22 [W] Oh what if I get accused of violating the code of conduct what should I expect? What should happen?
00:16:23 [W] The what we would recommend and what also the contributor confident recommends is if you if you are informed and you would be informed by the code of conduct committee.
00:16:37 [W] Hey, you know, we have this complaint against you we are researching it.
00:16:42 [W] And the first thing is to just deal with it in a professional manner deal with it in the same way where if you were at work and a co-workers gave you feedback that you had somehow not been working with them as well
00:16:53 [W] You could have been the best thing to do is just take a pause.
00:16:58 [W] Listen to the feedback.
00:17:00 [W] do not attack them.
00:17:02 [W] Do not be sarcastic, you know, just kind of take a pause listen to the facts or the information that's being communicated to you work to understand how you may have not responded
00:17:15 [W] Did in the best possible way and any damage you may have caused another person and try to treat it as a learning opportunity.
00:17:25 [W] None of us are perfect.
00:17:29 [W] None of us are born knowing how to behave in most situations based on my toddler's Behavior.
00:17:38 [W] But, you know just think we can all inadvertently cause harm and we can all be under a lot of stress and cause harm maybe less inadvertently, but if you just
00:17:45 [W] Stick to the facts listen to the information be open to personal growth and just learning how other other person's perspective may give you the opportunity to grow, you
00:18:00 [W] Demonstrate your willingness to work with the team as they understand what's going on that will go a long way. Obviously, it really depends on the egregiousness of the action. But if you are entering into something in good faith and not
00:18:15 [W] tending to hurt anybody just participate openly don't attack anybody, you know, just kind of treat it as a learning experience and Trust the project maintainers to act in a fair and just manner so
00:18:30 [W] what we would recommend so then the another question is won't a code of conduct have a negative effect on the end product and the you know, the
00:18:45 [W] An answer there is that there is zero evidence that adopting a code of conduct has a negative effect on code quality.
00:18:56 [W] It will affect the experience of those who participate in communities where a code of conduct is enforced ensuring that more people feel safe contributing to a project can significantly improve the quality of the code base.
00:19:06 [W] That's for many reasons having a code of conduct and having a professionally professional behaving a community that really values being polite.
00:19:14 [W] To each other and being kind to each other grows. The number of people who will feel safe engaging with that community and providing their time and their contributions to that Community additionally.
00:19:29 [W] The code of conduct gives everyone the same framework for which to base their actions around so it kind of takes the guesswork out of interactions.
00:19:44 [W] We all know what's expected of us were all building the positive kind community that we wish to be a part of and it's healthier for everybody.
00:19:50 [W] Nobody likes being in a toxic environment and a toxic environment is very draining on everyone who's part of it whether or not they're part of a marginalized Community within that.
00:19:59 [W] Toxic environment. So by ensuring that we continually invest in having an empathetic professional and kind Community.
00:20:12 [W] Lady of all members of it to continually contribute to it in a meaningful and impactful way finally we have why should my community have to change to accommodate marginalized people obviously a part of
00:20:24 [W] Answer here.
00:20:26 [W] is that the kubernative community has always wanted to accommodate marginalized people and we're just trying to be more organized and more thoughtful about how we do that as part of our code of conduct and as part of our community outreach, but
00:20:40 [W] The more broad answer is that the level of accommodation that the code of conduct implies is not higher than the one that is expected when dealing with peers and other professional settings.
00:20:56 [W] So with the code of conduct were not trying to be more accommodating to one group.
00:21:00 [W] We're trying to make all contributors feel welcome and safe.
00:21:01 [W] So why why do we have a committee?
00:21:09 [W] Let's see.
00:21:10 [W] Thanks.
00:21:10 [W] Here we go.
00:21:14 [W] So black lives matter black lives matter.
00:21:16 [W] So the kubernative community has taken the public stance of making sure that everyone who comes to the kubernative dot IO is aware that the kubernative community is in complete support of the black lives matter
00:21:29 [W] Movement we stand in solidarity with the black community and racism is unacceptable racism conflicts with the core values of the kubernative project and our community does not tolerate racism
00:21:44 [W] to just go a little further this statement on the kubernative main page is reflective of our values as a project the code of conduct committee would invite anyone who is confused about this statement
00:21:59 [W] Or who has perhaps received misinformation about why black lives matter is an entirely appropriate and important thing for all of us to be able to say to really invest in personal inquiry and research
00:22:14 [W] Search on why you would want to deflect a statement specific to Black lives doing when people deflect a statement specific to Black lives back towards everyone including yourself
00:22:29 [W] This is a common way of further discounting the experience of black people.
00:22:35 [W] Stating that black lives matter in no way and stimulates that other lives.
00:22:41 [W] do not matter. So if this statement is somehow making you have a negative emotional reaction. We do encourage you to take the opportunity to learn more about the black lives matter movement,
00:22:55 [W] And why the community kubernative community leadership is compelled to make a clear and unambiguous statement on it.
00:23:03 [W] A quick word about intersectionality.
00:23:12 [W] I think a lot of people may not have heard of intersectionality. Maybe everyone attending this kind of fog has I'm certainly not someone who could give a great talk on this.
00:23:24 [W] I think it's a very nuanced and very important field of research, but I did want to kind of call this out because I think it's a good learning opportunity for everyone to kind of understand what intersectional theory is and why it's important to sort of have this empathy.
00:23:36 [W] You for people who are different in different ways.
00:23:44 [W] So I did include some links for people who'd like to learn more about intersectionality as you can see from the different from the definition here.
00:23:55 [W] What intersectional theory is about is the interconnected nature of social categorisation such as race class and gender as they apply to a given individual or group and this can be regarded as creating overlapping and
00:24:05 [W] Dependent systems of discrimination or disadvantage and so through an awareness of intersectionality. We can better acknowledge and ground the differences among us sort of what we're looking to do here is encourage everyone to have
00:24:21 [W] But the and be polite in your interactions in our community and be secure in your ability to expect the same from others.
00:24:29 [W] So what more can we do in the kubernative community and as the code of conduct committee?
00:24:46 [W] So the code of conduct committee is pretty focused on WE enforce the code of conduct. We own the code of conduct.
00:24:53 [W] but as a community of codifying correct behavior and building out group Norms is really just the first step.
00:24:57 [W] to all of the things we can achieve when we are successful in our mission to create this professional safe space for people to do their best.
00:25:03 [W] Twerk. One thing that we can do as we successfully on board new contributors from a wide range of diverse backgrounds is that we can increase the ability of the kubernetes project to
00:25:17 [W] I'm bored new contributors.
00:25:24 [W] So if new people start coming in from all sorts of different backgrounds and all sorts of different areas.
00:25:29 [W] We can start having a more diverse range of skill sets and capabilities that we haven't seen before some examples are while a lot of people think of the kubernetes community and immediately think of systems-level go programming, you know, we also need docks
00:25:40 [W] As we also need ux designers. We need UI designers and Builders.
00:25:47 [W] We have all of these different facets and capabilities that the kubernative project can benefit from and as we make sure that we are providing a safe professional environment for everyone to be productive in and everyone to do their best work in we're seeing more and more people who
00:26:01 [W] Aren't systems-level go programmers also on board into the project and also be successful and I think that that's a really great sign for any as a couple examples.
00:26:16 [W] We had a group of product managers who came in and started really running a product management group for a long time in kubernative.
00:26:21 [W] Use we have Sig usability that's recently stood up. We have Sig UI and then we have program managers and project managers who are helped and
00:26:31 [W] Lise managers who are help keeping the kubernetes releases stable and on time and super well organized.
00:26:40 [W] So all of those things are necessary and all of us working together to be super productive and super proactive only makes the community stronger.
00:26:53 [W] Additionally we have been as a community starting to invest in asking all leaders of the community to take the same training so that we're all coming from the same place.
00:27:02 [W] Been formed and fatigue empathy.
00:27:05 [W] So for example recently the steering committee asked all of the chairs and tech leads in the kubernative community to take unconscious bias training and I did include the link to that at the end of this presentation.
00:27:18 [W] It's a Linux Foundation course on speaker.
00:27:24 [W] It's really speaker training so you can learn to make sure that anything that you're providing to as part of a presentation that you're giving is inclusive inclusive speaker training and so
00:27:31 [W] And we also as the code of conduct committee take enforcement training. So Enforcement Training sounds pretty harsh but it's basically this idea of how do you approach a situation in which the code of conduct is being reported as being violated in
00:27:46 [W] That tries to lead towards Community healing so I think it's very valuable.
00:27:52 [W] So here are the additional resources. I promised to include so at the top you can see we have the code of conduct. We have it listed on the website and the code itself. If you want to go read it the contributor Covenant, which is that
00:28:10 [W] Student community that maintains the code of conduct that we then use in our projects then we have a link to the inclusive speaker orientation, which I really recommend even if you're not giving a talk, I think it's great
00:28:25 [W] is a very training and then we have some information about intersectionality for those who haven't heard about it or want to learn more the top one is just a five minute video clip and then the bottom one is a TED Talk that can barely Crenshaw gave that's a really awesome overview about
00:28:40 [W] Intersectionality and why it's so important so that wraps up my material for today.
00:28:46 [W] Thank you everybody for attending and yeah. Have a great day.
00:28:51 [W] Cool.
00:28:57 [W] Hi everybody.
00:29:01 [W] Thank you for attending this talk today.
00:29:12 [W] I think we went over a lot of really good material. If you have any questions, I'll be in the slack Channel and as always if you ever need to escalate anything to the attention of the code of conduct committee, please do so we are always
00:29:16 [W] Is there and ready to listen to any problems?
00:29:19 [W] You may be encountering?
00:29:20 [W] So, thanks.
00:29:21 [W] Have a great day and talk to you soon.
