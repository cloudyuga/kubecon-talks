00:00:02 [W] Okay, welcome to the cube Kong Europe virtual Summit.
00:00:11 [W] This is the policy working group Deep dive session and to punk from far away and America America from Red Hat.
00:00:19 [W] Okay, we're going to be talking about all the development happening in the policy working group in communities as well as at the sincere.
00:00:33 [W] Sig security level
00:00:36 [W] Okay, we'll be just basically talking through all the interesting things.
00:00:42 [W] Okay, we are from the markdown files.
00:00:50 [W] Yeah, yeah.
00:00:52 [W] Yeah join us regularly Wednesday's or every other Wednesday around 4 p.m.
00:01:00 [W] We should update that.
00:01:02 [W] Yeah, 8:00 a.m.
00:01:04 [W] Pacific.
00:01:10 [W] Yes, we are.
00:01:14 [W] That's why I missed it several times.
00:01:18 [W] It's good for east coast in Europe, especially.
00:01:19 [W] Yep.
00:01:23 [W] I were working to provide an overall architecture describes current policy relating to patients and discussing everything else future policy and policy architecture for kubernative and how that extends into the cloud native ecosystem
00:01:37 [W] We have been running for like two years almost two years now.
00:01:42 [W] Yep.
00:01:45 [W] Yeah.
00:01:47 [W] Yeah, as long as it's basically around the acquisition of Korra.
00:01:58 [W] Yep, that's something couple Acquisitions later.
00:02:00 [W] We're still at it because yep turn turns out policy still matters.
00:02:05 [W] Okay, I think yeah this lies about so I think we've been seeing like trends like tidal waves.
00:02:16 [W] So kubernative like Envoy.
00:02:18 [W] No doubt is the first wave about the cognitive platform.
00:02:24 [W] Then we see the emphasis on Prometheus Jaeger opentracing P fo R star to focusing on the observability.
00:02:38 [W] And now I think people are really turning attentions to policies and securities. Like we were seeing Opa are making like big stages.
00:02:48 [W] Cognitive tasks notary from the my you team and see Falco and Commander really interesting projects.
00:03:02 [W] I think this is where me and Robert get into really interesting discussion outside interests.
00:03:18 [W] What is cloudbees to fall asleep?
00:03:29 [W] What is Connie's your Posse? Well, this is I think the blue points are like the things we hope the clinic policy could become so I think
00:03:32 [W] It goes beyond auditing and compliance by that. I mean like for we are seeing things for like resource management and probably many other
00:03:46 [W] Serious. Oh, it's a all-encompassing policies all-encompassing thing.
00:03:56 [W] And I think Robert makes a good point.
00:04:06 [W] It seems the a correct tooling that policy could help Autumn is like security and many other areas of policy self rarely not always
00:04:17 [W] And yeah palsy. I'm usually like Logics, so it's definitely it's definitely different from config.
00:04:28 [W] I've been having problem about like just having a llamo based config system.
00:04:39 [W] You call it a declarative system.
00:04:39 [W] It's not.
00:04:40 [W] Not necessarily not necessarily. So but if you have a policy based system is it would be really nice declarative system meaning you could talk a logic like human
00:04:56 [W] Readable logic to that system.
00:05:00 [W] Yeah, that's very declarative and to an abstraction.
00:05:14 [W] Yeah, we are not there yet. But hopefully we can have like the policy descriptions and policy driven mechanism each layer,
00:05:20 [W] So we see Opa for the policy control on a pretty high level I think for policy agent.
00:05:33 [W] Yeah open policy agent.
00:05:37 [W] We have like see Liam for like policy toward EBP F. We have Falco doing things for runtime policy.
00:05:49 [W] That's pretty low level, right?
00:05:50 [W] Hopefully in the near future we can have a multi-layer.
00:05:55 [W] Policy McKenna's, ohms, then we have the antenna attraction like every year that every layer.
00:06:04 [W] we have a way to talk to using logic.
00:06:08 [W] To talk to them and yeah, bring Lively is to a cloud right?
00:06:18 [W] It's human toxin logic not config files.
00:06:24 [W] That's that's that's machine language.
00:06:27 [W] But yeah, that that's just something I thought.
00:06:29 [W] yeah, it's a whereas config is your about it's not policy can be configured and configuration can yeah, they're
00:06:45 [W] but noticing yeah, I think that's interesting that policies the dynamic in some sense or
00:06:51 [W] how do you take a set of principles and make decisions based on Dynamic data in the cluster?
00:07:01 [W] Okay.
00:07:07 [W] Sorry, I forget I don't like pushing magalix. Whoops.
00:07:13 [W] Okay?
00:07:16 [W] All right.
00:07:20 [W] incorporate a lot of robbers comments or anything.
00:07:21 [W] So I think he made a great Point controllers are neither because human and policies defines what controls and what Implement that technical.
00:07:38 [W] that's that's very nicely put
00:07:41 [W] and we have every domain specific policy implementations.
00:07:49 [W] And hopefully on the like that expression evaluation who stick level we can have something really generalize and also the architecture we can we can have something
00:08:05 [W] three General
00:08:07 [W] I think quickly go over the yeah. This is how policy working you interact with other six.
00:08:21 [W] Yeah, basically all of them, but you know, we're pulling the strings so mustard.
00:08:34 [W] Yeah some of the places though that it really interact.
00:08:40 [W] So when you're talking about the network, which is the first area of people often think about configuring fire rules.
00:08:42 [W] And cigar.
00:08:46 [W] Yes.
00:08:46 [W] Yes. That was good.
00:08:47 [W] Yeah, how big is Klein?
00:08:52 [W] Yeah.
00:08:54 [W] Even bigger than that. Yep.
00:08:58 [W] Just is this walking on your screen?
00:09:09 [W] Anyway, okay. Anyway, you got a picture.
00:09:14 [W] We go.
00:09:16 [W] go yeah, let's jump to next next.
00:09:24 [W] There we go.
00:09:28 [W] I think we can also quickly go over the things we already already.
00:09:31 [W] Some of the areas that we've been exploring our on the very abstract side is some formal verification.
00:09:42 [W] remember, how do we how do we go from a set of yam all files to knowing that it does what you want it to do.
00:09:51 [W] So we have some.
00:09:54 [W] Example you have it.
00:10:00 [W] Yeah, I think this is Robert's Guardian.
00:10:02 [W] proposal
00:10:04 [W] Yeah.
00:10:07 [W] I didn't you see it this a lot of how do you know that no one has access to a given resource when you have defined policies and terms of dynamic or labels label selectors for instance in an airbag system
00:10:23 [W] Can you take some amount of okay?
00:10:31 [W] Well, we can actually go through and figure that out formally make sure that what you intended how you described your intent work?
00:10:37 [W] We have a pilot project called Guardian.
00:10:43 [W] Please come and purchase paid a lot of math.
00:10:50 [W] All you Matthew people out there.
00:10:51 [W] Yeah perfect place to come in.
00:10:54 [W] I mean who doesn't love some math, Maybe?
00:11:04 [W] All right.
00:11:05 [W] All right.
00:11:07 [W] All right. So, you know, we we we haven't done a lot in this year but in the past the white paper, yeah,
00:11:20 [W] Really interesting part is we did a lot of case studies in light interesting project and the team came over to talk about what what they are using
00:11:36 [W] policy for and what they are hoping policy who could achieve
00:11:41 [W] maybe try to keep tabs on all the projects are coming up and connect people as needed to, you know, make no confine common patterns.
00:11:56 [W] See what's catching on where for instance kubernative is lacking or where there can be some
00:12:03 [W] Collaboration we will get to some of the operation later.
00:12:09 [W] Yep.
00:12:15 [W] Also we get to geek out and ask questions to all of the really cool projects.
00:12:17 [W] So these are interested.
00:12:21 [W] You can check on YouTube. And for the presentations.
00:12:23 [W] Yep, lots of kubernative opa. So open policy agent gatekeeper project for using
00:12:31 [W] Open policy agent for kubernative policy admission controller. If Co course the class servicemeshcon.
00:12:44 [W] Helium is also is it considered a servicemeshcon all as well?
00:12:52 [W] You know, I think sitting me is like a level level working policy.
00:12:58 [W] Yeah.
00:13:03 [W] The spiffe. Yeah using BPF we yeah.
00:13:07 [W] Yeah, they're funny.
00:13:07 [W] Yeah, but area
00:13:09 [W] spooky Spire for service Discovery in automation
00:13:15 [W] tough notary in-toto Toto and obtain about securing the supply chain cover. No weirdo.
00:13:27 [W] Hey, that's another kubernative policy admission control.
00:13:31 [W] Claude custodian verifying your Cloud configurations and like AWS for instance with I am policies.
00:13:40 [W] K rails from what who's from the self-driving startup?
00:13:48 [W] And yeah, and then we don't delve in a little bit more to pain security policies and how they can be real work with gay or how gatekeeper can Implement obscurity ballsy's. Yeah.
00:14:04 [W] Let's see.
00:14:09 [W] You want to talk about other?
00:14:17 [W] Yeah.
00:14:21 [W] Yeah. Yeah. So I think Jim is special team has done a lot of work really great work and
00:14:27 [W] Yep can always come easy another policy engine in addition to Opa?
00:14:37 [W] 460
00:14:42 [W] oh, but Oprah is a whole system right that contains a link posted specific language to implement a database to store. The policy is a the, you know, certain plugins the
00:14:58 [W] agents to help you horse the policy that's really powerful but
00:15:05 [W] Sometimes that's more than everyone wants for kubernative.
00:15:18 [W] He's one of the things there are certain kind of cases that you'd like to just Define in some communities resources have a standardized way and have that enforced within the cluster.
00:15:20 [W] Yeah running.
00:15:23 [W] So that's where cover no cup is try coming in where upon creating a namespace
00:15:29 [W] What kind of certain resources automatically need to be created for instance roll bindings and other controls walk those who shouldn't be able to do something
00:15:44 [W] more specific validation or mutation control markings resources automatically with certain labels or directing pods
00:16:00 [W] And they're scheduling automatically based on the namespace.
00:16:03 [W] Or validating spent only certain labels are used those sorts of things.
00:16:11 [W] Yep.
00:16:14 [W] Crow custodian I think Rocco.
00:16:20 [W] Sylvia is another really interesting project.
00:16:22 [W] They're mostly like working on the college level, right?
00:16:28 [W] Okay.
00:16:29 [W] Yeah, the
00:16:32 [W] There isn't a clear boundary necessarily between like your cluster your workloads and platformer the cloud or resources.
00:16:43 [W] It's running on so securing that all across consistent ways important.
00:16:49 [W] Yeah.
00:16:51 [W] Well High Cloud is a big thing these days. Let me know. How do you consistently you might use terraform to assistant Lee provision your infrastructure, but now how do you
00:17:02 [W] Ensure that you have your policies and access controls for instance for all of the different clouds done correctly.
00:17:11 [W] That is where I'm Christian comes in.
00:17:16 [W] That's a nice pitch for the multi-cloud.
00:17:23 [W] Sorry.
00:17:27 [W] It's it's a big use case.
00:17:28 [W] Yeah, definitely.
00:17:30 [W] All right.
00:17:33 [W] Here we go.
00:17:35 [W] They yeah, I as to remember they had a great presentation.
00:17:50 [W] I think they mentioned they actually use Google Groups for for their like Tendencies system, which is really really interesting.
00:17:56 [W] Thinking from their face from like the employee level all the way down.
00:18:05 [W] Yeah, I think that makes sense.
00:18:11 [W] Yeah, the mentioned the you are running a really big workload.
00:18:12 [W] ubernative.
00:18:13 [W] And like each department has to be isolated.
00:18:18 [W] From each other for for whatever reason and they have the K real developed to deal with their specific situations.
00:18:31 [W] God security policies
00:18:40 [W] So what's the latest I haven't been able to catch up with her?
00:18:45 [W] I need to check the latest on that issue.
00:18:51 [W] Whatchu is it.
00:18:54 [W] Has pairs P entirely like retired and all the things going to get keeper.
00:19:02 [W] No there that is some sense.
00:19:11 [W] Never a hundred percent going to happen.
00:19:16 [W] If just let's just take a long long time.
00:19:17 [W] Longer than there.
00:19:20 [W] Do do do.
00:19:23 [W] I will find.
00:19:25 [W] the issue at some point
00:19:31 [W] once
00:19:36 [W] Google Docs can load.
00:19:40 [W] swear there was
00:19:46 [W] Okay, that was a bad.
00:20:07 [W] Sorry North well anyways seek off session possibly will we measure the progress on PSP?
00:20:27 [W] Siri and used
00:20:30 [W] career that he's built in mechanism to ensure pods that don't have proper permissions are running less privileged contexts.
00:20:44 [W] Has it languages and beta right now?
00:20:46 [W] One of the problems we deal with in policy is how do you safely turn on policy without breaking everyone?
00:20:55 [W] How do you move forward? How do you
00:20:57 [W] How do you change policies safely especially when changing a policy can make it so you can't change policy if you do it wrong?
00:21:08 [W] so
00:21:11 [W] one way though, if you already are using Opa gatekeeper is a great way to basically get the same functionality.
00:21:26 [W] All right moving down the stack.
00:21:30 [W] Okay, I'll take this one.
00:21:36 [W] I haven't been following up with our PI initiative.
00:21:40 [W] Is this like?
00:21:43 [W] Came to any solution.
00:21:48 [W] The there are runtime policy.
00:22:02 [W] Yeah, I only remember we did we did we did couple session with the Falco team.
00:22:15 [W] But yeah lost track how well things.
00:22:19 [W] Yeah, but this is I think this is one really interesting thing for policy to to happen low level.
00:22:37 [W] It really low level.
00:22:39 [W] Yeah part of it.
00:22:46 [W] What will we say runtime?
00:22:51 [W] It's when you have your containers or other workloads literally executing instructions.
00:22:54 [W] How do you hear that?
00:22:55 [W] Yeah one way is to have agents on the Node various ways that are reading policies checking for violations walking violating
00:23:10 [W] actions
00:23:11 [W] I think they can even combine the RPI with with suiting so you have policy checking's runtime for the pods and you can checking on the pot networking.
00:23:28 [W] something Violator
00:23:31 [W] and you can't you can't you can do all the things with edps?
00:23:39 [W] Just writing some EPF programs.
00:23:49 [W] Check up on those just following along with the evolution from monitoring to policy the next natural place.
00:24:00 [W] All right.
00:24:01 [W] All right.
00:24:03 [W] and for all of these different things quite often policy projects like this want to use the standardized kubernative zci to Define policies.
00:24:17 [W] So one thing we want to do is standardize what that looks like. So the tools can be more easily interchanged.
00:24:25 [W] And that you know truly built on top of these can interact together that brings us to our first policy.
00:24:37 [W] Okay, because resource people see report project.
00:24:48 [W] Lots of different tools are helping us develop this and eat, you know Alpha Testing Epi or you know engaged what's Polaris.
00:25:06 [W] Laris
00:25:11 [W] is it like a kubernative project or even it is fair wind up to do?
00:25:24 [W] Oh, yeah.
00:25:24 [W] Yeah.
00:25:24 [W] Yeah.
00:25:25 [W] Yeah hilarious.
00:25:26 [W] Fried of checks to make sure kubernative is pods and controllers are configured using best practices.
00:25:34 [W] Oh cool as a dashboard evaluating web hook and a command line tool cool.
00:25:41 [W] Obviously a lot up a lot has happened in the policy field.
00:25:49 [W] There's always new projects.
00:25:54 [W] Yeah, where then
00:26:00 [W] We have a nice table.
00:26:06 [W] color this cluster image
00:26:13 [W] image where you looking?
00:26:18 [W] sorry like the TV the category is image meaning for talker image?
00:26:25 [W] Scanning.
00:26:28 [W] Yeah, maybe therefore the pre-image security.
00:26:33 [W] Yeah, you know make sure that you know, you're not running malicious containerd.
00:26:39 [W] This one's from Aqua security.
00:26:43 [W] So they gave a presentation last week.
00:26:45 [W] Yeah make your presentation it, you know, make sure that you're running Lee validated images.
00:26:54 [W] Detecting vulnerabilities, but it comes with a pretty nice dashboard interface as well.
00:27:02 [W] I think it's yeah mostly not some direct image as a scanner on to show it right now, but I think there's some
00:27:13 [W] future plans
00:27:16 [W] Yeah, you do.
00:27:22 [W] then
00:27:25 [W] Cube Cube edges another sort of conformance might be I think is a big the right categoria.
00:27:34 [W] Do you have your is your cluster set up the way you think it will be?
00:27:40 [W] They're using policy for for like benchmarking. The Koster. I believe at kubenetes is like are you following best practices? Okay.
00:27:54 [W] Yeah, so they are scanning for things.
00:28:04 [W] Yeah, do you have?
00:28:10 [W] the
00:28:12 [W] so this also comes product security best practice like see is benchmarks for instance.
00:28:24 [W] Yeah. Yeah.
00:28:26 [W] Got it.
00:28:26 [W] ah.
00:28:27 [W] yeah, so one of the ways for instance some aqua security product also has project called starboard one of the things that they're reporting and running our c is cute - Benchmark tests so that can also
00:28:43 [W] Hopefully soon be reported back in the standard format.
00:28:49 [W] nervous pretty
00:28:52 [W] As you can see, we have more policy tools and engines and ways to do it than we can keep track of that.
00:29:02 [W] We could ever imagine.
00:29:03 [W] What is our policy on policies?
00:29:10 [W] Our interface we have a cup using the place. The policy report is meant to capture a higher level. Not necessarily A my like second by second report
00:29:26 [W] But you know at it report at the level that makes sense for to be stored as a customer sourcing kubernative @ CD.
00:29:35 [W] want it to be flexible enough to show for what all these different tools and compliance means allow enough detail so that you know Auditors and cluster admins can
00:29:50 [W] Understand what has happened during who's going on and why?
00:29:54 [W] But it still needs to be clear and standardised enough that standard kubenetes tools can manage it?
00:30:07 [W] We have some examples within the policy prototypes GitHub repo I think kaeru. No and the multi cluster project from Red Hat
00:30:23 [W] Have some examples submitted of what the kind of policy reports that they would be creating with their tools.
00:30:29 [W] Okay, we have scope.
00:30:32 [W] summary
00:30:36 [W] results
00:30:38 [W] Hey, this is pretty nice.
00:30:41 [W] Yeah, I think it's one of those things where turns out having more input you get better things and learn things.
00:30:50 [W] You didn't know maybe we have the alpha sort of merged into that repo any pull requests or issues or welcome and we're working right now to get
00:31:05 [W] it more tools directly implementing it and testing it out so that we can
00:31:14 [W] Move to Beta right?
00:31:29 [W] All right. This is like our for deliverables so far.
00:31:32 [W] I fit into the big picture thing. So we have cri-o these we have formal education.
00:31:37 [W] It is interesting. We have the try to have a standard way to interact.
00:31:47 [W] And the RPI is for the data point.
00:31:54 [W] Yeah, okay, please join the conversation and the conversation it should that slide be deleted?
00:32:05 [W] There's a backup site in case people are interested in smt.
00:32:13 [W] What the heck is form of Education.
00:32:19 [W] Yeah, it's very important that people who didn't quite get the math part of it. Yeah.
00:32:24 [W] Got it.
00:32:28 [W] All right.
00:32:31 [W] All right, please join join us or we look forward to think I'm talking more about policy.
00:32:37 [W] Yeah, okay.
00:32:40 [W] I think that's it for our session and stop.
00:32:43 [W] Hello a my life can everyone hear me?
00:33:28 [W] All right.
00:33:32 [W] Hopefully you can thank you everyone for coming.
00:33:39 [W] This is actually pretty big crowd compared to it normally comes to our lab ones.
00:33:43 [W] We have two minutes or so. So some quick questions. We had number one about pods curity policies and using gatekeeper to replace it currently gatekeeper does not apply mutations.
00:33:54 [W] And yeah, that is a missing functionality right now to get it as a full replacement.
00:34:02 [W] I hope we didn't imply it's a hundred percent ready to replace it hundred percent.
00:34:11 [W] I think it's on the road map, but I'll have to find the issued firm with a gatekeeper people in the in their slack.
00:34:17 [W] They mentioned just recently but you might want to use kubenetes meant integration which does support mutation to do that to get a similar function.
00:34:24 [W] Reality today then last question was around policy hierarchies.
00:34:34 [W] yeah, so in general we found that you're always balancing the complexity of
00:34:42 [W] Policies and having different levels to allow more complex kind of, you know delegation and divisions on the other hand, you know eligibility and simplicity.
00:34:58 [W] We when researching noticed that in general two rings of higher policies and hierarchies tend to be what people settle around.
00:35:10 [W] I'm not exactly sure what that seems to be what happens in most cases?
00:35:17 [W] And kubernative of course kind of also settled into that with the namespaces and cluster wide as sort of the default kind of Divisions.
00:35:31 [W] So we haven't really explored too much going.
00:35:34 [W] We've kind of kept with that in most of our thoughts the multi-tenancy working group has some thoughts around worked for tenants, which kind of has a new layer there if you're interested in that.
00:35:45 [W] But otherwise, thank you for coming please stop by the working group and help us work on the policy.
00:35:59 [W] All right.
00:36:01 [W] I think that's my time.
