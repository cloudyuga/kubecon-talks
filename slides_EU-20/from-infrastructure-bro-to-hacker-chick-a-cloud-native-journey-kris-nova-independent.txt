00:13:12 [W] So, please do listen to these disclosures here first of all.
00:13:17 [W] I'm going to do my best not to offend anyone.
00:13:22 [W] I really am.
00:13:26 [W] I put a lot of thought into my words and I have been working for about a decade now on this skill to really think about what I'm saying before it actually comes out of my mouth you would you would be surprised how many people have yet to develop or Master this skill, so I will
00:13:37 [W] Proper vernacular when appropriate and I will do my best not to offend anyone but there is a but however, I do apologize. I do offend anyone and I encourage you to share that with me so that I can learn and so that we can teach
00:13:52 [W] And so I will do my best and if I do offend you or if you feel like I could have offended somebody else.
00:13:59 [W] Please do let me know. I mean that sincerely
00:14:01 [W] next I encourage you to talk about this.
00:14:10 [W] I encourage you to talk about this presentation with your friends with your partners with your mom with your boss with your kids.
00:14:18 [W] I really encourage you to desensitize the world to what I'm about to say and at the very least.
00:14:23 [W] Maybe you have a good conversation and get to connect with somebody you love.
00:14:25 [W] So I encourage you to talk about this there is a but however
00:14:28 [W] Please do leave me out of your personal conversations.
00:14:33 [W] I love you all.
00:14:40 [W] I promise. I am very interested in a lot of your personal Journeys. But if I was to spend time out of my day connecting with every single person here, it would be overwhelming and it would exhaust me to be a full-time job.
00:14:47 [W] So know that I love you, but please do you know keep this to yourself.
00:14:53 [W] This is your journey for your footsteps alone.
00:14:54 [W] I mean this sincerely I am annoyed.
00:14:59 [W] I have to give this talk and what I mean by that is I love speaking at coupon.
00:15:04 [W] I love all of you.
00:15:06 [W] I'm beyond stoked to be giving a talk.
00:15:14 [W] I'm annoyed that it's 2020 and I'm on stage having to bring this to life because I feel like as a society and as a people we should have been passed this a long time ago.
00:15:20 [W] While mean and it would exhaust me to be a full-time job.
00:15:23 [W] So know that I love you, but please do, you know keep this to yourself.
00:15:24 [W] This is your journey for your footsteps alone.
00:15:25 [W] I mean this sincerely I am annoyed.
00:15:25 [W] I have to give this talk and what I mean by that is I love speaking at coupon.
00:15:26 [W] I love all of you.
00:15:27 [W] I'm beyond stoked to be giving a talk.
00:15:28 [W] I'm annoyed that it's 2020 and I'm on stage having to bring this to life because I feel like as a society and as a people we should have been passed this a long time ago.
00:15:30 [W] So I am annoyed with the fact that we haven't surpassed this journey as a society yet. So hopefully
00:15:33 [W] I can in a small way encourage everyone here watching this to take one small tiny step towards the path of making it such that people like myself don't have to give talks like this anymore.
00:15:38 [W] But I'm going to give it anyway because it's important.
00:15:42 [W] It's important to me.
00:15:44 [W] It's important to you and I love all of you in a lot of people are talking.
00:15:49 [W] I am going to do my best to read this but there's a lot of noise here.
00:15:50 [W] So yeah, if you have something to say I am reading it and doesn't it.
00:15:57 [W] I'm happier. Your daughter's watching hi to decimas daughter.
00:15:57 [W] Cheers.
00:15:58 [W] Okay.
00:15:59 [W] So those are my disclosures.
00:16:02 [W] Anyway, that's me.
00:16:03 [W] me. I'm super gay and I climb mountains and that's me on top of Mount Hood and in the background you can see Mount Rainier.
00:16:12 [W] And Adams and that's I think Mom heard.
00:16:14 [W] The Summit is 11,000 feet above sea level.
00:16:15 [W] It's right next to Portland, Oregon and that is that's I think January of 2018.
00:16:23 [W] It was super sunny day, but super icy cold.
00:16:29 [W] Anyway, I climbed to the top of the mountain and I brought a pride flag and somebody took a picture of me and I like to use that my slides if you have questions if you need help if you need somebody to talk to if you need me to connect you to someone that's my open source email address.
00:16:38 [W] It's all over the Internet. So
00:16:42 [W] and like if you email me I might email you back.
00:16:43 [W] We'll see how it goes.
00:16:45 [W] But if you need to get ahold of me, that's that's a good place to start.
00:16:47 [W] Girls, but if you need to get ahold of me, that's a good place to start.
00:16:53 [W] So feel free to save that and use that as you as you need. Okay, let's get started and on that note coffee.
00:17:00 [W] So we're going to talk about my gender transition.
00:17:05 [W] We're going to talk about open source software and we're going to talk about my career.
00:17:10 [W] All of these things are tightly coupled to some extent based on.
00:17:12 [W] on a lot of things and primarily the fact that if it wasn't for my career in Tech, I ironically don't think I would have been able to afford a gender transition and if it wasn't for my gender transition
00:17:26 [W] Don't think I would be where I am today in my career.
00:17:35 [W] So all of these things kind of happen in a weird order, but I think the order is important and honestly, they all have a lot to do with each other and they are all kind of in this weird. Like, I don't know if you've ever seen the people who like you put the buckets down and everybody leans on each other then you can take
00:17:45 [W] With each other and they're all kind of in this weird. Like I don't know if you've ever seen the people who like you put the buckets down and everybody leans on each other then you can take the buckets away and then everybody stands up.
00:17:48 [W] That's how I look at my career like everything would come falling down if I tried to do it at one time, but just because of the way we set it up it now holds itself together. So anyway, we're going to we're going to kind of get into it here.
00:17:59 [W] Okay once upon a time.
00:18:05 [W] I'm hoping everybody is lot in my mind.
00:18:11 [W] Everybody's laughing right now once upon a time.
00:18:17 [W] I was a f****** bro. And I mean this I was the Bro east of bros you guys I was 26 years old.
00:18:23 [W] I had got a job as a Linux server administrator at a company in Lakewood, Colorado and I wore khaki pants penny loafers and a button-up shirt my first day
00:18:36 [W] I walked in there like I knew everything and really all that I did was I had read a few articles on Lennox and I took a test and I happen to pass it and it was beyond easy for me.
00:18:49 [W] It was easy.
00:18:50 [W] I got a job.
00:18:51 [W] I walked in they liked me.
00:18:52 [W] I was charismatic sign here.
00:18:54 [W] I got my first tech job and I was wanting his server administrator and that is that was my intro to my career. I mean I had done other things. I had worked in data centers and pulled cables and I was an electrician for a while, but this was my first like desk job.
00:19:10 [W] Bob Wright, and I was not a good person to say the least and we'll get more into that moment.
00:19:14 [W] So let's talk about what it was like at my first job.
00:19:20 [W] So let's see Francis says great.
00:19:24 [W] It's also my first keep calm and I'm super grateful and pleased for all the information good to see you Francis.
00:19:27 [W] So my first job I didn't really know what to expect.
00:19:28 [W] I was at the very bottom.
00:19:30 [W] I was just an icy. I was a lowly engineer and there was this like confusing org chart above me.
00:19:34 [W] I didn't really even understand and everybody I worked with was very much like me. We were, you know, kind of like hanging out we work together we worked on
00:19:44 [W] Same thing and it was it was very it was very easy for me to fit in at the bottom layer. And we kind of all just looked up at this nebulous blob of people above us and and that was what it was like for me.
00:19:56 [W] and when I say
00:19:59 [W] Job, I didn't really know what to expect.
00:20:06 [W] I was at the very bottom.
00:20:06 [W] I was just an icy.
00:20:07 [W] I was a lowly engineer and there was this like confusing org chart above me.
00:20:07 [W] I didn't really even understand and everybody I worked with was very much like me. We were, you know, kind of like hanging out we work together.
00:20:08 [W] We worked on the same thing and it was it was very it was very easy for me to fit in at the bottom layer and we kind of all just looked up at this nebulous blob of people above us and and that was what it was like for me.
00:20:10 [W] and when I say
00:20:12 [W] Sorry, I had a phone call when I say it was easy for me to get along.
00:20:13 [W] I mean that I was able to connect and I was able to adopt the culture of those around me and that may seem like a very powerful thing. But there's one problem which was this was the
00:20:21 [W] In that I was able to connect and I was able to adopt the culture of those around me and that may seem like a very powerful thing. But there's one problem which was this was the culture
00:20:23 [W] Me and I kid you not my my first job.
00:20:29 [W] I was on a team of six other men.
00:20:35 [W] My boss was a man his boss with his a man. His bosses colleague was a man in the CEO was a man and the CEOs daughter was a head of HR.
00:20:42 [W] She was the only woman I ever saw around the office and that was that was that was normal.
00:20:48 [W] That was my first job that I was desensitized to that from day one.
00:20:49 [W] worked at that place for three years and this this cold
00:20:54 [W] ER was it spread and people came and went and as people came and went the culture came and went with them and my culture continue to grow and my culture continue to spread and this is just
00:21:06 [W] And this this culture was it spread and people came and went and as people came and went the culture came and went with them and my culture continue to grow and my culture continue to
00:21:08 [W] They learned right?
00:21:09 [W] So let's talk about what that culture was.
00:21:17 [W] So what I learned after looking back at my first job many years later was men enjoy to do manly things. So I want you to imagine a group of men hanging out at work competing with each other they
00:21:29 [W] They were literally fighting with each other for fun.
00:21:35 [W] They were sparring over code and this culture was it was recursive it grew right and and as people came and went the culture went with them and as my career progressed as the more I fed into
00:21:48 [W] As people came and went the culture went with them and as my career progressed as the more I fed into this culture the more I was rewarded the easier it was for me to be effective and to be like a good kid.
00:21:57 [W] To be effective and to be like a good kid at my job.
00:22:01 [W] So I found this really great picture that I want people to really take a deep.
00:22:05 [W] Look at that for me.
00:22:05 [W] really encapsulates my first job.
00:22:07 [W] This right here.
00:22:18 [W] This was rewarded people looked at this what you're seeing, you know a couple of of white guys hanging out talking about code drinking a beer and some coffee, you know looking like they're productive and and this was rewarded if you did
00:22:26 [W] it's hanging out talking about code drinking a beer and some coffee, you know looking like they're productive and and this was rewarded if you did this you got a promotion period And if you you got to the point where you got a promotion if you did more of this
00:22:33 [W] And if you you got to the point where you got a promotion if you did more of this you would give more promotions and then you could teach people how to do this. And then and then those people would get promoted and next thing, you know, you see this sort of like telescoping nature of this culture that
00:22:43 [W] it's sort of like telescoping nature of this culture that I was a part of and I didn't know any better of
00:22:46 [W] but something was wrong and something was kind of like jerking me in the back of my head. And as I started to, you know engineer my way through that I started to learn more and more about myself and about what was going on and I started to have these thoughts of like
00:23:02 [W] Maybe this culture isn't right for me. Or or maybe this isn't the healthiest culture for me. And then I started to look at my relationship with women in the office.
00:23:13 [W] I was mean I was manipulative. I was derogatory.
00:23:19 [W] I used to say things like write a unit test like a man and now I say those same things ironically because I actually used to say them sincerely and it wasn't a healthy culture for me.
00:23:29 [W] It certainly wasn't a healthy culture for others and it didn't really and
00:23:32 [W] Spire anyone to make the software better. It inspired us to focus on the culture that more than it inspired us to focus on the software inspired us to be toxic.
00:23:46 [W] I was toxic. So if you think about it when I use the word toxic, what I like to say is toxicity Grows Right, if you if you look at you know, if you look at how bacteria works if you look at how
00:24:03 [W] Like a toxic spill it pollution works it spreads and as one thing becomes infected.
00:24:14 [W] Hello, 2020 other things can become infected and before you know it you have this pandemic and what I noticed was the spreading nature was what was rewarded if I walked into the office like I want
00:24:24 [W] Walking into the office and you know sitting down at my desk and like did the classic grow like I don't know if y'all have ever seen anybody do this to headphone slam.
00:24:33 [W] We're like, you know, oh, you know my code failed or like the Cron job broke or the bill didn't work. And you do the headphone slam you like you stand up table flip and everybody gets all pissed off.
00:24:48 [W] It was this reactive angry culture and that's that was good.
00:24:56 [W] That's what that's what people rewarded and if you yelled at people and if you manipulated people and if you tried to lie about the person next to you to get ahead that was rewarded.
00:24:59 [W] And that was the culture that I was brought up in and that is the culture.
00:25:02 [W] I see a lot even to this day.
00:25:04 [W] Remember earlier in the talk.
00:25:05 [W] I said I was annoyed to give this talk.
00:25:08 [W] This is one of the reasons why is because we're still dealing with this.
00:25:15 [W] So anyway, as I'm going through a lot of this I realized one hate this culture.
00:25:18 [W] This is not good for anyone into I'm different.
00:25:20 [W] this this isn't me? This doesn't feel right? Like I was doing it because that's what I saw and that's what was rewarded and I was very good at this thing called chameleonian or I got
00:25:31 [W] I guess I just confirmed that but I was a chameleon meaning I could change who I am to match my surroundings such that I would fit in and it was really I had been doing it my whole life.
00:25:42 [W] It was really easy for me to do that at work and just say oh yeah, I'm a toxic bro like it out of my way.
00:25:43 [W] So I began questioning my gender and I realized this was actually a more accurate representation of the org chart. Now.
00:26:09 [W] This is this was fundamentally hard for me because so many people saw the org chart as it was before and so many people had these pre-built cognitions in their mind about who I was and what I was that for me to challenge that
00:26:18 [W] This is really hard. Especially when you look at the dynamic between well like even if you look at the endocrine system, but if you look at the dynamic between masculinity and femininity, it's not easy for feminine minded people to challenge
00:26:35 [W] It's just fundamentally hard.
00:26:42 [W] So I started taking HRT. I started taking estrogen and that changed everything for me.
00:26:46 [W] I mean it changed the way I look at the world the lens in which I perceive the world begin to shift.
00:26:47 [W] It was a biological change.
00:26:50 [W] I had never experienced anything like it in my life.
00:26:54 [W] I wrote a blog post that I think encapsulate sthis and I'm going to use the title of the blog post to very clearly articulate what I had to end up doing in order to survive in this particular situation.
00:27:06 [W] I had to learn how to become a lady like a man and what I mean by that is I had to fight I had to get angry I had to compete I had to challenge those around me and speak the language of those around me in order for me
00:27:21 [W] Embrace the feminine side of myself in my career.
00:27:26 [W] So naturally this was hard.
00:27:27 [W] This was not easy and I began to get frustrated and it didn't work and I quit the job and I started another job and like version 2.0 and fast forward 12 months and I'm out of there. And so I started to notice that this
00:27:41 [W] fast forward 12 months and I'm out of there and so I started to notice that this was this was a pattern and I started to look at exploring how I was going to deal with this how I was going to start managing
00:27:50 [W] To deal with this how I was going to start managing this and that's when I started to notice things in the culture became important to me and that's when I began to notice how the in-person culture really changed the software.
00:28:03 [W] four
00:28:04 [W] I like to say I was lost in a wasteland of toxic masculinity.
00:28:13 [W] I was in a situation where the software was like item 427 on the list of things to do and you know, the first 100 items were just like how can you outgrow the person next to you?
00:28:26 [W] II didn't do well in that environment and I began to look for for different jobs for different roles that would in brace this diversity in myself and embrace his feminine side of me.
00:28:38 [W] So the lesson here is toxic culture spreads and I want you to look at this in more than just masculanity and feminity right toxic culture can be any culture.
00:28:55 [W] I've heard of companies who have toxic workout culture.
00:28:59 [W] that is if you if you are one of the people at your office who don't work out every day your kind of put lower on the totem pole than those around you.
00:29:08 [W] I've heard of culture that is toxic scholarly culture. That is if
00:29:10 [W] Don't if you're not published if you don't read scholarly articles, if you don't cite your sources, if you're not a linguistic expert you are considered lower and inferior than those around you.
00:29:22 [W] So when that we can flip that around and we can say that not only does toxic culture spread, but we can actually have like positive culture and we can spread that as well.
00:29:33 [W] We're going to get more into that in a moment.
00:29:37 [W] But toxicity is it's hard.
00:29:38 [W] it's manipulative and it definitely has this ability to to change you and it has a really really low barrier to entry it's really easy to slip into it and it's really hard to get out of it once you get into it.
00:29:52 [W] Threatening enough that I threw my hands in the air and I was able to get out of it because I really fundamentally had nothing else to lose.
00:30:07 [W] So that's that was the first big major lesson.
00:30:08 [W] I learned in my career was be aware of what's happening around you at the social level because that's going to have a big impact on first of all your personal health, but more importantly on the software that you're building or the product that you're designing or the people that you're working
00:30:23 [W] Rumors that you're engaging if you if you are customer facing and you work in a toxic work environment.
00:30:33 [W] The customer is going to know that the moment you walk in the door and they're going to smell it in there and it's either going to jive with their toxicity in which case you're just havin a big old toxic party and then everybody's hanging out or they're going to say hey, you know what?
00:30:43 [W] This isn't really working out for us.
00:30:46 [W] So it's just taking a step back.
00:30:52 [W] Remember one of the first things I did was take a breather it just evaluating it and saying like, you know on a social level what is actually happening.
00:30:58 [W] And what types of behavior are being rewarded at my workplace or at my work?
00:30:59 [W] LOL big ol toxic party?
00:31:00 [W] Yeah, okay.
00:31:02 [W] Enter I feel like you can seem to enter open source.
00:31:11 [W] So as I'm going through my career, I discovered that you know working on a team was hard for me especially because most of the team's I worked on were primarily man dominated and
00:31:24 [W] Okay.
00:31:25 [W] Enter I feel like you know seemed to enter open source.
00:31:26 [W] So as I'm going through my career, I discovered that you know working on a team was hard for me especially because most of the team's I worked on were primarily man dominated and
00:31:27 [W] to hide
00:31:27 [W] I began to to look for things to do on my team that did not involve engaging with the people around me.
00:31:35 [W] I wasn't happy there.
00:31:37 [W] I needed the paycheck. I like Cody and I like doing what I was doing, but I didn't necessarily like the what I would I would consider the Whiteboard experience and I am watching the clock here. If somebody could tell me what time
00:31:50 [W] So I know how much time I have left.
00:31:53 [W] That would be helpful.
00:31:55 [W] But what I consider the Whiteboard experience which is, you know, walking into the office pulling out your whiteboard pin and you're starting to draw on the wall and you know, you're having the conversation and you're talking up here and you're doing this whole like back and forth saying for me that was that was
00:32:08 [W] Imitating experience because what I noticed was whoever talks the loudest and yell the loudest and seemed the most angry was typically the one who dominated the conversation.
00:32:24 [W] Whereas there's like little old me sitting in the corner. Like, can you please just use blue when you're just talking about databases and read when you're talking about database relationships and quit yelling at each other please I in an approximately eight minutes.
00:32:32 [W] Okay.
00:32:32 [W] I'm going to hurry up. Thank you Christophe. So anyway the community here is what
00:32:39 [W] Really really worked well for me and I began to oh, I have 12 minutes left Okay cool, so I can slow down a little bit.
00:32:47 [W] Thank you. So the community is what I defaulted to because that involved working with people remotely and these people big secret here. They take know anything.
00:32:57 [W] Tell me.
00:32:58 [W] So I began to transition and I began to work in open source, and I put together a small list of projects here that I worked on while I was I would say transitioning or
00:33:13 [W] It's not it's not as finite thing. Like you never done.
00:33:18 [W] I'm still transitioning.
00:33:25 [W] I started HRT like eight years ago and like I've had some surgeries and like I'm still Transit a you know, I've grown my hair cut my hair.
00:33:27 [W] I've grown my hair cut my hair like it's a lifelong process.
00:33:30 [W] It's like are you ever done learning emacs?
00:33:31 [W] Are you ever done learning Linux?
00:33:33 [W] Like no.
00:33:34 [W] It's a lifetime thing.
00:33:38 [W] So anyway, I began to be myself and I started to love myself and wear what I wanted to wear and identify as I wanted to identify.
00:33:44 [W] And I began to see really work on these open source projects both for fun and for work and I discovered some very interesting things about working in the open source Community with people from all over the world.
00:33:56 [W] nobody cared
00:34:04 [W] as I was doing all this I remember I think I was I was working and IRC and I had like, you know, I'm thinking about it days. Like I was like crying that was happy.
00:34:19 [W] I was crying and I was couldn't sleep and I was like, I'm gonna tell the people and I are see that I'm trans woman and you know, it freaked me out freak me out of freaked me out. And I finally I remember I typed it I deleted it. I typed it. I deleted it and finally hello
00:34:28 [W] nobody cared
00:34:29 [W] as I was doing all this I remember I think I was I was working and IRC and I had like, you know, I was thinking about it days. Like I was like crying that was happy and I was crying and then I was couldn't sleep and I was like, I'm gonna tell the people and I are see that I'm trans Woman
00:34:31 [W] It's nóva the trans woman and I just close my eyes and just hit enter and they were like OK you still f***** up the last commit.
00:34:39 [W] I don't know.
00:34:40 [W] What do you want me to say here?
00:34:41 [W] Nobody cared was the point.
00:34:44 [W] I'm trying to make and that was beautiful and I loved that.
00:34:45 [W] That was the first time I felt normal if you remember at the beginning of the talk I said, I'm annoyed. I have to give this talk. That's the feeling that I wish we had in Tech was this feeling of like it doesn't matter.
00:34:57 [W] matter. It's just like whatever you're not special. I really
00:34:59 [W] I really wish that day could come.
00:35:01 [W] So anyway, this was my new gender identity for about a year and a half.
00:35:10 [W] I'm going to try to leave some time for questions to what I mean by this is I was Chris nóva on GitHub.
00:35:22 [W] In fact the Chris nóva name came from an algorithm. I roll a known algorithm a phonics algorithm and I just, you know, put a bunch of names into it and it picked out Chris nóva, and I thought that was a pretty name.
00:35:33 [W] So I named my GitHub that and then, you know a year and a half later that actually became my last name.
00:35:36 [W] So I literally named myself after my GitHub handle. But anyway, this is this was my new gender identity for the longest time and when I went to work,
00:35:42 [W] I was kind of this weird like queered crossdresser boy-girl thing when the people at the coffee shop called me her and the people at work called me he and it was just kind of like whatever and I just kind of dealt with it, but, you know open source, it
00:35:57 [W] Just raincoat.
00:35:59 [W] So that was me just stick em it Charles hanging out in the commit logs.
00:36:04 [W] Not a boy.
00:36:05 [W] Not a girl wearing a dress being me write in code and it was beautiful.
00:36:16 [W] Okay. So let's look at the open source org chart here.
00:36:23 [W] In fact even look like right now like literally this is this is a great example, even in the slack that I looking at. You know, it looks like somebody just said, hey you're doing awesome.
00:36:27 [W] And we got some thumbs up and we
00:36:30 [W] Some other people, I don't most of these people.
00:36:39 [W] I don't know what gender they are there just in name and you know, most of them don't even have like images for their name. Like there's a person right?
00:36:41 [W] It's like have you ever heard the expression?
00:36:42 [W] What do you call a male man?
00:36:43 [W] Yeah.
00:36:45 [W] The mailman is coming.
00:36:46 [W] They are coming to my house. They it's a you don't know if it's a boy or a girl even though it says mailman which is kind of screwed up. But the point I'm trying to make is a lot of these people. I just they're just people and that's what I was and encapsulating that in your org chart is absolutely beautiful.
00:36:59 [W] Beautiful. So what I would do is I would encourage more people to stop looking at masculinity or femininity and to stop saying be a lady like a man or stop saying, you know, this is toxic or this is non-toxic or this is feminine or this is masculine and just say we're people and
00:37:14 [W] A boy or a girl even though it says mailman which is kind of screwed up. But the point I'm trying to make is a lot of these people. I just they're just people and that's what I was and encapsulating that in your org chart is absolutely beautiful.
00:37:16 [W] So what I would do is I would encourage more people to stop looking at masculinity or femininity and to stop saying be a lady like a man or stop saying, you know, this is toxic or this is non-toxic or this is feminine or this is masculine and just say we're people and
00:37:18 [W] Do people things so I could be myself in this was liberating because all of a sudden I was happy.
00:37:29 [W] I was smiling and I was like going to work and I was like, I'm gonna go hang out with the homies and IRC and yeah, I don't know if they're boys or girls and we're just going to do our thing and it was it was really rad nóva in Polish means new. Yeah.
00:37:35 [W] That's why I picked it.
00:37:39 [W] It's it's Icelandic for new. It's Latin for new.
00:37:42 [W] new. It's pull-downs polish for new. I'm sure it means new and a few other languages as well Chris new. It's the new Chris right? Do you get it Chris nóva?
00:37:45 [W] Yeah, right.
00:37:47 [W] See you put a lot of thought into this.
00:37:50 [W] So yeah, I could be myself and that that was inspiring and people around me noticed.
00:37:55 [W] I was happier and I was happier and I began to develop relationships and my code got better and my presence at work out better. And even though I was the only girl in my org, I was still successful because I was confident. I was happy I had that confidence
00:38:08 [W] Key, white guy Tech bro, because I was letting myself and that was one of the first Secrets I learned in Catalan. Nóva is feminine for knew that beautiful.
00:38:19 [W] Thank you.
00:38:20 [W] Okay.
00:38:23 [W] So this is it.
00:38:24 [W] I've been guarding a lot.
00:38:26 [W] I don't know if we have gardeners out there, but I found my garden I found a place where I could be the new Chris where I could grow where I could turn into this person.
00:38:35 [W] I was always meant to be and in order to do that. I first had to protect myself. I had to create the safety bubble where
00:38:39 [W] I could be me and after I started to grow people said hey, that's you know, she's growing there and there's something to this.
00:38:48 [W] We should we should we should encourage this.
00:38:51 [W] We should we should be a part of it and it wasn't always easy. Right? Like it wasn't just like all of a sudden everything was great, like people tried to you know people yell at me on the internet even to this day I get cussed out on Reddit people's food mediums that are evil.
00:39:01 [W] It's not easy, but like there's definitely more good in growing than bad.
00:39:09 [W] So I let myself grow. So this is the second lesson here.
00:39:11 [W] Let yourself grow be you.
00:39:15 [W] Right if you want to write code write code.
00:39:17 [W] You want to wear a dress wear a dress.
00:39:19 [W] Do you want to write unit tests write unit tests?
00:39:20 [W] I promise you you're going to make the world a better place. If you're contributing to open source, and you do what you love and you really try to make open-source better. People are going to notice that and people are going to be inspired by that and people are going to be intimidated by that and it's going to be really powerful for you.
00:39:38 [W] Is Harbor growth and Innovation if you want to innovate if you want to grow you need a safe environment you need a garden.
00:39:46 [W] Okay, so let's let's get real.
00:39:52 [W] You should have you should probably write unit tests.
00:40:01 [W] Yeah. Well, you should write unit tests, but I'm saying if you would like to be the one on your team who writes the unit tests go for it. If you don't want to write unit tests, you should probably still write unit tests.
00:40:03 [W] So anyway, it wasn't that long ago.
00:40:06 [W] This is one of my first commits to kubernative Ace.
00:40:11 [W] I tried to find the first one, but I was lazy and I got tired of skimming to get logs.
00:40:11 [W] So I just picked this one. Anyway the point I'm trying to make here is this it wasn't that long ago that I transitioned right like
00:40:17 [W] I used to go by Chris Childress.
00:40:22 [W] This is my old name and that's my email address there my first few commits to kubernative.
00:40:28 [W] He's I still had a big capital M on my driver's license for mail.
00:40:33 [W] So as kubernative has grown I've grown and as kubernative has grown I've grown and as I've come and gone into kubernative and progressed into other tools.
00:40:42 [W] I've continued to grow because of the garden I've built for myself. So the kubernative community gave me a really great Garden, but I've taken that garden and
00:40:47 [W] I transplanted that and I'm now building other Gardens.
00:40:50 [W] So I learned to be proud of my name and of my work but not like the bad kind of Pride like the good kind. Like I really am proud of the work that I've done because I really worked hard on it and I wouldn't be proud of it in a good way if I
00:41:07 [W] Is grown I've grown and as kubernative has grown I've grown and as I've come and gone into kubernative isn't progressed into other tools.
00:41:10 [W] I've continued to grow because of the garden I've built for myself.
00:41:11 [W] So the kubernative community gave me a really great Garden, but I've taken that garden and I've transplanted that and I'm now building other Gardens.
00:41:12 [W] So I learned to be proud of my name and of my work but not like the bad kind of Pride like the good kind. Like I really am proud of the work that I've done because I really worked hard on it and I wouldn't be proud of it in a good way if I
00:41:16 [W] Chronosphere it everybody hates their code.
00:41:17 [W] Everybody looks back at the code and says, this is garbage. If you go look at my original cops code.
00:41:17 [W] I'm like, what was I doing?
00:41:18 [W] This is Java written in go, but that's okay.
00:41:23 [W] I'm still proud of it because I was growing as I was writing it and even though my name was wrong in my gender was wrong. I'm still proud of the commits that can mean.
00:41:30 [W] So it turns out my code in my work was fantastically beautiful when I love myself, even when it was ugly.
00:41:38 [W] It was still beautiful and still gorgeous.
00:41:46 [W] So as I continue to love myself I continue to grow in my garden and I continue to inspire myself and Inspire other people and it turns out you can actually create some really pretty really beautiful things and it doesn't have to be this toxic masculinity
00:41:53 [W] You can actually write pretty code and you can have beautiful code and that's a good thing more people should write pretty code period I'm sorry more people should have rainbow code more people should rate pretty code.
00:42:07 [W] It should be easy to read it should make you feel good.
00:42:08 [W] It should be beautiful.
00:42:09 [W] I became addicted to Growing myself my career my hobbies.
00:42:22 [W] I started climbing mountains. Like I just I couldn't stop everything I wanted to do was was all about growing and what I noticed was let me go back as I was growing.
00:42:31 [W] I started to help other people around me grow.
00:42:33 [W] I started to create other Gardens.
00:42:37 [W] So let me tell you guys the big secret to getting promoted at your job the big secret to becoming an open-source Champion the
00:42:42 [W] Big secret on becoming a leader a thought leader if you want the big secret and becoming the person you want to be in your career the next level up in your career the leader the champion.
00:42:54 [W] Become a gardener.
00:42:57 [W] Help other people grow in the same way that you can grow.
00:43:02 [W] You have to help others.
00:43:08 [W] You would be astonished how many other people have never been given a chance to just grow just become who they want to be because they've been spending their entire careers and their entire lives trying to be this person just to fit in but the second you light a fire underneath someone and
00:43:17 [W] Be themselves you will be astonished on what they can do.
00:43:21 [W] I assure you so inspiring other people is equally as important as inspiring yourself.
00:43:26 [W] So teach others how to grow.
00:43:29 [W] so remember
00:43:32 [W] toxicity spreads both in the good way and in the bad way.
00:43:38 [W] There are safety and open source.
00:43:41 [W] You can be yourself. You can be a commit show.
00:43:43 [W] Find yourself a little garden.
00:43:47 [W] And you can grow into something beautiful in the right environment.
00:43:52 [W] help others to grow
00:43:55 [W] Thanks, everyone.
00:44:04 [W] Yep, that's it.
