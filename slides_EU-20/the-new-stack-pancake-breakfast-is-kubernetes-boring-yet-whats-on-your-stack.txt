00:05:58 [W] Hey everybody live from remote wherever you are.
00:06:04 [W] We're still enjoying pancakes, even though we wish we were all still in Amsterdam.
00:06:10 [W] I'm Alex Williams founder and publisher of the new stack and I have a great group here with me today joining us are Priyanka Sharma High Priyanka.
00:06:22 [W] How are you?
00:06:23 [W] Hello Alex, and everybody else.
00:06:27 [W] I am great excited to be here.
00:06:28 [W] R were truly eating pancakes priyanka's general manager of the cloud native Computing Foundation Johnny care MSB principal Analyst at Janek Airmen Associates.
00:06:39 [W] Logdna.
00:06:41 [W] Hey, Alex.
00:06:42 [W] Hello.
00:06:42 [W] Everyone.
00:06:42 [W] Great to be here.
00:06:45 [W] Wonderful to have you and Patrick McFadden Chief evangelist for Apache Cassandra datastax.
00:06:50 [W] Morning, Alex.
00:06:52 [W] So here we are. I came here pancakes, but I'm staying for the kubernative.
00:06:57 [W] That's right.
00:07:01 [W] All right and bills age a crazy little director Solutions engineering at dynatrace held hey Bill.
00:07:03 [W] Good morning.
00:07:04 [W] Hello everyone.
00:07:07 [W] Hey, I got my pancakes here.
00:07:12 [W] Can somebody pass me the syrup or butter or anything that you might have over there. I'll say thank you. Thank you Patrick.
00:07:16 [W] Oh, thanks for the butter.
00:07:19 [W] Got the costume. Steal things. No toppings.
00:07:19 [W] Nice job.
00:07:24 [W] Actually the syrup or butter or anything that you might have over there.
00:07:29 [W] I'll thank you.
00:07:29 [W] Thank you Patrick.
00:07:29 [W] Oh, thanks for the butter.
00:07:29 [W] Got the costume scoffs.
00:07:30 [W] Yeah topping billion.
00:07:30 [W] Nice job.
00:07:30 [W] I'm going to start with this syrup here and put them on my pancakes.
00:07:31 [W] I think one of the things I want to do is just let's just share a little less a little share a little Amsterdam here.
00:07:33 [W] Look at those pancakes for that's from a restaurant in Amsterdam.
00:07:38 [W] Good ol Amsterdam.
00:07:41 [W] What a wonderful place it is is this supposed to be at ease because I really wanted to be there.
00:07:47 [W] I know I think it is.
00:07:47 [W] It feels like that.
00:07:48 [W] Doesn't it?
00:07:54 [W] in any case I want to just thank you all again for being here and our discussion really is about
00:07:58 [W] His kubernative boring yet, and I want to ask that question, you know MBA specifically what's on your stack? We're talking pancakes here.
00:08:10 [W] We might as well talk about technology stacks and one of the things that we are seeing is it's what's on top of kubernative that counts if a structure is almost becoming boring as some people would say
00:08:24 [W] Shin really is about is kubernative boring yet. And I want to ask that question, you know MBA specifically what's on your stack.
00:08:25 [W] We're talking pancakes here. We might as well talk about technology stacks and one of the things that we are seeing is it's what's on top of kubernative that counts if a structure is almost becoming boring as
00:08:26 [W] Calls it a natural substrate that is just becoming part of what we do Kelsey Hightower would say that the the plumbing works now, it's important what's on top of it.
00:08:39 [W] So that's the question.
00:08:41 [W] I really want to ask today and Priyanka.
00:08:44 [W] maybe I can start with you, you know is kubernative boring. Yeah is is the plumbing working is
00:08:50 [W] Is the stack?
00:08:53 [W] There for people and you know, what are the different types of stacks that you're seeing people develop?
00:09:00 [W] Yes, absolutely.
00:09:06 [W] I think kubernative is getting close to boring and we are very proud of that.
00:09:07 [W] It's a good thing.
00:09:11 [W] It's solid and mature and that's equivalent Dvorak and I say kudos to the community and ecosystem for getting there.
00:09:17 [W] I think the in all seriousness.
00:09:23 [W] This is not something to underestimate just because of all the hard work that goes into making something stable and reliable. I think though vile the core technology itself might be approaching.
00:09:29 [W] Being boring.
00:09:33 [W] I don't think that's the case for all the surrounding ecosystem around it.
00:09:38 [W] If you think specifically let's say carrier networking.
00:09:40 [W] There's a tremendous opportunity for Telco.
00:09:47 [W] To modernize their infrastructure needs and reduce operating costs and that's something there's a lot of work going on with like conjunction of cncf and Linux Foundation networking in which lots of Telco Zar involved.
00:09:58 [W] So that's an area where I see a lot of interesting happening soon currently happening and continuing to evolve. I think those use cases will become more and more popular people will see that additionally I think by using kubernative
00:10:12 [W] As you come up with new challenges as as a as a software company as engineering organization and that space.
00:10:23 [W] I think it's still there's a lot of innovation happening.
00:10:34 [W] I mean, I think very recently it's kind of become clear that it's that servicemeshcon are very important and it's going to be a multi Mass meshwork world. So that's awesome.
00:10:39 [W] We want to support multiple servicemeshcon Loom and standardized and do the best things for their end users. So I think there's a lot of in-toto.
00:10:42 [W] Sting coming soon with the foundation of a boring boring kubernative which is exactly how it should only I liked him ask you this question Priyanka was just talking about servicemeshcon an interesting topic these days.
00:10:57 [W] She's talking about the support of multiple servicemeshcon.
00:11:05 [W] She's talking a lot about I think what comes down to participation in the community and who actually is represented and how they get represented properly which plays a big part in developer experiences, which plays a big part in the actual technology.
00:11:12 [W] Grk textures themselves.
00:11:14 [W] So Johnny, what's your thought on the react architectures of today and the plumbing itself?
00:11:21 [W] And what's been built on top.
00:11:23 [W] Are we ready to really build on top?
00:11:25 [W] all
00:11:27 [W] Oh, absolutely.
00:11:30 [W] So servicemeshcon.
00:11:57 [W] Door opens up additional developer experience and it is also becoming the foundation for serverless.
00:12:05 [W] For example, if you if you look at connective connective is built on top of a steel and that is actually delivering the serverless and even driven execution on top of kubernative.
00:12:17 [W] So in terms of innovation, we are going to see a lot of advancements when it comes to servicemeshcon.
00:12:27 [W] read servicemeshcon
00:12:40 [W] I'd like to just point out that one of the key highlights. I was making was that kubernative being boring kubernative being stable and Eagles oldest exist, and then like it could prove the developer experience.
00:12:56 [W] Earth well bill. I have a question then what's not boring?
00:13:02 [W] So anything that's really beyond the microservices development inside of kubernative is really fascinating to me.
00:13:12 [W] So a lot of the team is already talked about things like functions running inside of kubernative.
00:13:23 [W] He's but then the servicemeshcon as simplifying the deployment in automating a lot of these other processes and procedures that need to be able to be deployed inside of these environments in order for management to be able to be maintained.
00:13:27 [W] There's lifecycle Management Solutions and testing Solutions and all these other different types of components that it's not boring. It's theirs
00:13:33 [W] So much different areas that groups can really even focus but still contribute to whatever they're really interested in it as well Patrick in transitioning here into this larger discussion when we start to look at, you know, the actual
00:13:47 [W] The things that we found in our research and it's in our ebook that were publishing in the next week or two about kubernative.
00:13:56 [W] Is this really the second edition of it little Shameless plug their download down.
00:14:09 [W] We were finding that deployments with more than five clusters have continued to rise but mostly among larger companies and I'm curious what this says to you
00:14:16 [W] G of growth and adoption for Nettie's and you know, there's others projects here that I think speak to that but perhaps you have some thoughts there on the actual growth and Adoption of kubernative it relates to clusters.
00:14:32 [W] Yeah, I mean when it comes down location infrastructure kubernative use is clearly establishing itself as like this is the way to do it and in Cross clouds on-prem wherever you are, I think there's two kind of go back to this.
00:14:47 [W] Is it boring yet?
00:14:50 [W] No, it's actually super exciting right now.
00:14:51 [W] We're at the end of the beginning kubernative.
00:14:54 [W] He's as it grew, you know, and this is just me as an infrastructure guy. I think it's replaced the app server. And so you see that
00:15:02 [W] Deployment you're not going to see deployments of JBoss and websphere.
00:15:09 [W] You're going to see deployments of kubernative.
00:15:12 [W] He's and what's really interesting now is and I and you know that I work quite a bit in this week. There's just like communities popping up around data in kubernative use and that's the missing link right now.
00:15:24 [W] I just did a talk this week about is kubernative is ready for data and spoiler alert.
00:15:29 [W] it's not it's built for applications and
00:15:32 [W] I'm your see that growth happening on the application to your were dumping things like running scripts. Like I hate to say it but things like chef and terraformer now going away.
00:15:46 [W] I love those tools. But you know, they're they're starting to go away servicemeshcon coming more of the standard but that growth in clusters is really on the application to your on the application here. What are the issues that people are facing that
00:15:57 [W] Tools but you know, they're they're starting to go away servicemeshcon coming more of the standard but that growth and clusters is really on the application to your on the application here. What are the issues that people are facing that is causing
00:15:58 [W] Causing the that is leading to improvements in the technology and crime o'clock again brought this up into podcast we did and he said that it's not necessarily the innovation of the individual.
00:16:12 [W] It's a problems that they're facing and the problems that they face lead to that need those new improvements.
00:16:19 [W] What are the problems that we're seeing for instance in the data plane that are leading to new improvements.
00:16:23 [W] Shucks so Alex I can I can address the first one as well Enterprises using Beyond five clusters and then I'll come back to the get up late. So, you know a decade ago the the entire industry was talking about.
00:16:37 [W] What was called as VM sprawl in a remember when vmworld when VMware was very popular or getting popular among Enterprises and was extremely easy to launch a VM.
00:16:52 [W] Everyone went ahead and launch their own virtual machine and a lot of VMS were lurking around in the Enterprise Data Center, and it was very difficult for Enterprise it to take control and to basically do a stock
00:17:04 [W] Where the VMS are running how many games are running and whether they are compliant or not now fast forward to 2020 kubernative is experiencing a similar cluster sprawl today. It is extremely easy for developers to push a button and deploy a kubernative cluster.
00:17:20 [W] So whether it is managed kubernative service running in the cloud or a minikube running on developers laptop or more miniature versions of kubernative like kind and k3s there is kubernative everywhere and that is actually resulting in a
00:17:35 [W] Justice for All and again Enterprise. It is concerned that they have absolutely no control over the cluster scroll now, they are not able to basically enforce and impose certain policies that are absolutely critical for
00:17:51 [W] Enterprises so there are two parallel streams that are actually taking place one.
00:18:03 [W] The industry has started to realize that just the control plane that is managing kubernative is not not enough to take care of the cluster sprawl.
00:18:13 [W] So in the last one year, we have seen the meta control plane emerge and this pedal control plane is the control plane of control planes, right? Google was the first to come out with
00:18:20 [W] Us and the core premise or fantasies you run equipment is cluster anywhere.
00:18:27 [W] We'll manage it from gcps controlled plane Then followed the VMware, you know with with happy or acquisition and eke pivotal coming to VMware.
00:18:40 [W] They actually launched at anzu, Mission Control and than Zeus promises exactly the same we don't care where you're on your cluster.
00:18:49 [W] We don't care which flavor of cluster kubernative cluster you are running, but we will take care of the meta control plane and then k8s.
00:18:51 [W] As your Arc and then IBM multi-cloud manager, which is now rebranded as red hat at once cluster manager and then we have Rancher which is an open-source are now a part of Souza. So it's a very interesting Trend that we are seeing in the
00:19:05 [W] where you know days are gone when we are talking about managing the set of machines through an orchestrator, which is the kubernative control plane, but now there is a sprawl of clusters and we actually need a new metal layer to manage these clusters
00:19:21 [W] These clusters and that's where there is a very interesting Trend and this is going to enable Enterprises to enforce policies irrespective of where the customers are running that is on the commercial vendor side. Now the clustered API the the actual
00:19:35 [W] CeCe respect of where the customers are running that is on the commercial vendor side. Now the clustered API the the actual Sig that is working on managing the lifecycle of kubernative clusters from an existing coldest cluster is picking up a lot of
00:19:42 [W] On managing the lifecycle of kubernative clusters from an existing kubernative cluster is picking up a lot of momentum.
00:19:51 [W] So we'll actually see how a kubernative cluster can spawn a child cluster and manage the entire lifecycle just the way you do it with a part.
00:19:56 [W] So these two Trends are going to be significantly important for the future of kubernative the meta control plane the commercial implementation and then the cluster API, which is going to manage the lifecycle of kubernative clusters.
00:20:06 [W] And this is going to put some kind of, you know, the method to Magnus when it comes to managing dozens of kubernative clusters.
00:20:18 [W] So that is a very very important Trend that I want to call out Priyanka.
00:20:20 [W] Here here what Johnny said? So thank you for that. Very articulate description.
00:20:32 [W] I think yours extreme exactly spot-on that this is the new trend and it's based on as Alex was asking what are the problems people are facing which is there's clusters called there's so much going on.
00:20:40 [W] I would like to say like in general like, you know going back to the original conversation of it's like, you know, it's like some people have more more than five clusters on the rise Etc.
00:20:49 [W] There's no right size cluster for anyone. I mean you can easily have around
00:20:51 [W] I was in nodes per cluster and like that's fine for certain companies are certain size.
00:21:00 [W] But the real issue as Johnny was saying was that people have to manage, you know, they have various deployments and various clouds and having a better control plan that takes care of it is what helps people I think and the cluster API is also
00:21:09 [W] Pink the key.
00:21:15 [W] I think that tells us is that the multi-cloud world is the reality it's here to stay and that's a lot of innovation not just in the cluster management, but otherwise it's going to happen with that in mind.
00:21:27 [W] How can we help Enterprises and users big or small be able to go wherever the workloads our swap around workloads easily. The portability is going to be on everybody top-of-mind for everyone because it's unlikely that
00:21:40 [W] someone will stick to one cloud provider or bare metal or anything for across a vast amount of applications and products.
00:21:49 [W] Bill I'm curious on your thoughts here about about that role that we have now with clusters and and especially when because you were talking earlier about Automation and yeah for automation. Yeah, and it's interesting to see a lot of large organizations
00:22:06 [W] Is in some of the reasons are more Technical and some of them are more political the technical reasons High availability scalability requirements geographical requirements all makes sense. But a lot of organizations have multiple modernization projects going on internally, but every single
00:22:21 [W] Asian projects is based on kubernative which just speaks to the breadth and scope of what the platform can ultimately do as well.
00:22:30 [W] So it's everyone is betting on one horse.
00:22:35 [W] Just changing it a little bit differently and tweaking it a little bit differently to their specific use case.
00:22:37 [W] Hmm Patrick. One of the questions I have is about what Johnny was referring to he calls his Keda these these man, you know these new manager and platforms these these kubernative management platforms that are emerging such as anthes
00:22:50 [W] Just mom's Management on management platforms.
00:23:01 [W] And it also speaks then to one of the questions that I hear a lot these days is about what is then the role of the platform operator.
00:23:09 [W] What are the roles of the people who are you know who are who are not just the developers who are you know, just want to just all they want to do is code that that's just kind of their interest. There's also this camp.
00:23:22 [W] a power users out there who want to know about the infrastructure the want to know what's underneath and but they still need help as well, you know, and they still need these ways to manage the ark manage their their their clusters
00:23:36 [W] We're staying you know, for instance a datastax, you're building out operators. And so I'm wondering how you peace this, you know PCS pieces together when you're thinking about the overall management of these
00:23:52 [W] Is together when you're thinking about the overall management of these clusters in the sprawl that you know that we're referring to here?
00:23:57 [W] Yeah, I mean it's interesting.
00:24:01 [W] you know that the moms.
00:24:06 [W] Yes, then that appoints to I think a real I think something that can be addressed inside of the kubernative project where you know, there's a usability gap as soon as you see operators of operators, you know, that's one of the things that we're trying to work through
00:24:18 [W] and that appoints to I think a real I think something that can be addressed inside of the kubernative project where you know, there's a usability gap as soon as you see operators of operators, you know, that's one of the things that we're trying to work through
00:24:20 [W] In data and things like that, you know, you you have all these dependency management. So that could be a real potential Pitfall for the project is when it becomes over overstressed and it becomes impossible to work with
00:24:34 [W] Our services service companies such as the Googles and the Amazons and the Microsoft are going to try to make that experience a lot easier.
00:24:50 [W] But you know, there's I think there's a lot of operators out there that are looking for to reduce the toil and I hear that word a lot reduce the toil and we could do I think a better job of
00:24:57 [W] Kubernative approachable to mere mortals.
00:25:04 [W] You don't have to have 10 years of experience running infrastructure to do it. But operators are going that way.
00:25:11 [W] There's some cool projects that are trying to make it even easier like Kudo and the kublr which is an interesting project as well.
00:25:23 [W] You know, it's all of these projects that are happening are trying to make that a little more for Mortals.
00:25:25 [W] I would say, you know people that are just trying to get infrastructure out there.
00:25:26 [W] there. Let's get to it and you know people don't want to
00:25:28 [W] To run kubernative to run kubernative.
00:25:32 [W] They want to run kubernative to deploy an application to extract value from their company Priyanka.
00:25:38 [W] I know you'd like to say something. I'd also like to ask you as well about
00:25:41 [W] now one of the things that we are seeing in Johnny can attest to this maybe he can follow up and then we'll go back to bill again is we have these third-party providers who were building on open source, and then you have the managed service
00:25:57 [W] Company Priyanka.
00:25:57 [W] I know you'd like to say something.
00:25:58 [W] I'd also like to ask you as well about, you know, one of the things that we are seeing in Johnny can attest to this maybe he can follow up and then we'll go back to bill again is we have these third-party providers who were building on
00:25:59 [W] Google's and the AWS is of the world but the the Googles and the dove is the world may be more plain vanilla right then then what then wiped the third party provider offers because of their you know their
00:26:12 [W] This on a particular open source technology.
00:26:24 [W] So how does that play into the equation here and the factors that we're seeing with this overall experience that really is going to be critical.
00:26:24 [W] Yes.
00:26:25 [W] Absolutely.
00:26:28 [W] I'm actually very happy that that's the case that you have the cloud providers providing at least the base level that's needed with the manage solutions for kubernative.
00:26:40 [W] So, you know, you have G ke + AK and like, you know eks all of that stuff. So it's that's really good and
00:26:43 [W] Then there's the more specific Solutions out there for various reasons. I think at the end of the day as long as kubernative is getting in the hands of developers.
00:26:54 [W] We're good.
00:27:01 [W] I used to work at gitlab before and they were doing an excellent job of it, but just by disconnecting the developer experience into a whole devops experience and this is not me trying to make a plug for a certain company. But rather I appreciate that mindset
00:27:09 [W] At the end of the day as long as kubernative is getting in the hands of developers.
00:27:10 [W] We're good.
00:27:10 [W] I used to work at gitlab before and they were doing an excellent job of it, but just by disconnecting the developer experience into a whole devops experience and this is not me trying to make a plug for a certain company, but rather I appreciate that mindset where
00:27:11 [W] Whole conversation we've been talking about mere mortals.
00:27:16 [W] That's all of us that you know, and that includes devops professionals that includes application developers platform engineering there's so many names for teams to you know, at the end of the day some tooling that connects the dots
00:27:28 [W] Various job profiles and experiences is successful and luckily. We see all that happening in combination with the managed to provide managed services from the cloud providers.
00:27:44 [W] So I'd really think we are on a good trajectory for end users of all job titles to get more and more comfortable with kubernetes in addition to tooling. There's also an aspect of learning, you know, learning
00:27:56 [W] And something we see a lot at cncf is the big excitement that people have for our certified kubernative zeidman certified kubernative.
00:28:09 [W] Zap legation developer exams.
00:28:11 [W] People are studying hard.
00:28:13 [W] There's like I think five thousand see cans and 10,000 CK is already in existence and the rates are doubling especially, you know, actually in the current world of everybody at home
00:28:26 [W] the rates are doubling especially, you know, actually in the current world of everybody at home that there's been a great kind of momentum towards learning more and understanding so, I think this is just
00:28:34 [W] Two words learning more and understanding. So I think this is just this is just I would say a little after the beginning and more and more education more and more simplification combined together is going to produce the ongoing results
00:28:45 [W] More simplification combined together is going to produce the ongoing results that we're all starting to see Johnny before we get started with you.
00:28:53 [W] I do want to just say to all the people watching this that you will have the opportunity to ask questions at the end.
00:28:59 [W] And so there will have ten minutes for questions at the end of this discussion Johnny.
00:29:02 [W] I'm curious and your thoughts about that experience overall Chuck. So there are two things that I want to bring up one is
00:29:10 [W] kubernative has brought everyone to the same Level Playing Field, you know five years ago six years ago.
00:29:16 [W] scale was confined to hyper scale infrastructure providers know gcp AWS Hazard, but today kubernative has brought hyperscale possible and it has actually brought that into Enterprise Data Center and
00:29:31 [W] opened up is additional opportunities to replicate managed services that are exclusively offered by public Cloud providers in the kubernative Echo System, and I want to call out to specific examples here one is the vitess project
00:29:47 [W] Cncf project and that brings up so that actually brings up the ability to run a highly scalable highly available manage database like offering on top of kubernative cluster.
00:30:04 [W] Only available manage database like offering on top of kubernative cluster.
00:30:14 [W] And in fact, the the core committers and founders of vitess have now built a commercial offering called planetscale DB and planetscale DB delivers RDS in Amazon RDS or Azure SQL like reliability
00:30:20 [W] Gail just on kubernative so there is one example and then we have datastax now which actually build a commercial operator and a completely supported commercial model of Cassandra on top of kubernative and what it actually brings
00:30:35 [W] Be scalable highly distributed database something on the lines of n is on a road are multi. Multi remaster our Cloud scanner from Google or Cosmos DB like Capital T's just using kubernative cluster and
00:30:51 [W] Must he be like Capital T's just using kubernative cluster and open-source databases and Commercial operators and Commercial support.
00:31:00 [W] So, you know kubernative has become the Level Playing Field to bring in additional capabilities that were otherwise confined to just managed service providers and hyperscale providers through examples. That II wanted to call out.
00:31:09 [W] Yeah as Patrick is text it to me. I truckload of Pancakes just showed up and create a little bit of back noise here. So
00:31:15 [W] so I did go on mute there for a second, but the the questions that I think are coming up more to is in Johnny talks a lot about this and I'd like to ask as
00:31:30 [W] Showed up and create a little bit of back noise here.
00:31:31 [W] So I did go on mute there for a second. But the the questions that I think are coming up more to is in Johnny talks a lot about this and I'd like to ask as
00:31:32 [W] There's this there's this interesting kind of scenario developing where we have historically relied on platform as a service Technologies in the past to use for Developers.
00:31:47 [W] Now we're moving more into components and clean own containers as a services are emerging and I think that's what Johnny is talking about with these management platforms.
00:32:02 [W] But now you have this issue of configurators and like, you know who actually does the configurations that the developer is that the operations person and then on top of that then you have all the policy issues that come into play like who manages
00:32:13 [W] like mulch, so there's on so there's some authentication for instance that that can be that is critical if you're going to have any kind of really secure environment so,
00:32:29 [W] Bill, when you're thinking about through all those, you know types of issues.
00:32:34 [W] What are the what are the top challenges that you see know?
00:32:40 [W] What are like, what are the what are the things that are on your mind a lot?
00:32:53 [W] Well, I think it's what is the overall purpose of what this platform supposed to provide in? Most organizations have some sort of initiative to get time back to the developer have them just focus on creating custom Services custom logic that's going to move their business forward.
00:32:56 [W] So anything that can be done in more of an automated fashion anything that can be taken.
00:32:59 [W] Ian out of the picture for them and although there is the option of choice.
00:33:07 [W] How do we reduce the choices that they're going to have to be concerned about?
00:33:17 [W] How can they ultimately just create these services that can be put in front of whatever business justification that maybe as well so when it's whose response for this I think this is why we see such an explosion of kubernative Administrators. I think this is why we see a lot of people investing time effort and energy into these open source projects
00:33:22 [W] They're lying pipelines that have to be built. But when it comes to the actual services that have to be hosted on inside of these platforms.
00:33:36 [W] We want to reduce the amount of time and effort that those individuals creating those Services need to spend in the underlying work as well.
00:33:44 [W] Okay, a Cooper Danny's administrator is like we saw like the proliferation of dbe's back in the day.
00:33:46 [W] Are we going to see the collaborate the proliferation of kubernative Zim administrators Priyanka?
00:33:51 [W] I'm curious from your perspective.
00:33:52 [W] Are you seeing as this?
00:33:53 [W] kind of just a
00:33:55 [W] The way it's going to have to be is if we're going to see kubernative being managed throughout an organization and I'm wondering are you seeing any companies who are using kubernative throughout their organization? I mean sure there's some smaller startups who do but
00:34:11 [W] Larger mid-sized companies and and if so, or if not, you know, where are they where what's their progress?
00:34:20 [W] Yes.
00:34:22 [W] So to that point about kubernative administrators certified kubernative administrators are yeah the certification I know you guys are big on that these days.
00:34:33 [W] Well not just us the end users are big on it.
00:34:34 [W] That's the thing, you know, because and you know I learned about this even before I joined cncf full-time is my tikv.
00:34:41 [W] Team in the past. One of them have was a CK and he was so proud of it and he told me you know, it's like it's not just an easy search you can get online.
00:34:57 [W] I mean you have to study hard there is like, you know, it's not multiple choice if you have to actually put in answers and there's real Pride people are taking in this deep and knowledge because it's very meaningful.
00:35:05 [W] And so I think that's one of the reasons that this certification has really taken off and that it is a trend I think in general.
00:35:14 [W] About kubernative admits.
00:35:15 [W] Absolutely.
00:35:18 [W] I think a lot of people also do this these exams Etc 2, even if they're not going to be that admin in their company, like the person I was talking to is not an admin in the company he but not having this Baseline of knowledge.
00:35:29 [W] He is able to you know educate his team or you know participate in cool projects that may otherwise not have been accessible to him.
00:35:38 [W] Your by doing these becoming a kubernative admin. So I think that is a very healthy thing that's happening. And I think that more and more of such people like popping up in different companies. You don't have to have everyone take those exams or everyone become
00:35:57 [W] Pictures culture becomes very kubernative friendly you you know, you can tap your neighbor and ask questions about all these things.
00:36:06 [W] So net net.
00:36:14 [W] I think that trend is good and its continuing I think at least I can speak to what we're doing here in cncf in Partnership that I left training.
00:36:22 [W] We are also working through we just launched the security exam a certification and security for kubernative and we obviously have the application developer one.
00:36:27 [W] The reason for these coming out is again that that need for people to gain that extra edge of knowledge as they go about their day to day not everybody who takes these exams is in that full time role and I see that as a really good thing so
00:36:42 [W] All I think these are drivers of success for organizations.
00:36:51 [W] And then I think your second question was what was your second question?
00:36:52 [W] Sorry.
00:36:54 [W] I got so excited about the pruning boy.
00:36:58 [W] I was gonna die.
00:37:02 [W] I want actually let me think about the guy was this I think my mind is too.
00:37:04 [W] I think my mind's on pancakes.
00:37:10 [W] So I was actually thinking about it, you know more so well, let's transition. Maybe the better question really here is
00:37:13 [W] Is you know what are going to be the challenges that companies are going to have to face in scaling up and it seems like certification is a big part of it.
00:37:25 [W] I would agree with that certification is a big part of it.
00:37:31 [W] But of course there's many elements when your question is.
00:37:34 [W] What are the challenges of scaling up?
00:37:36 [W] that's like a wide landscape to answer but I think as one of the other panelists are saying there's the technology aspect of the challenge and then there is the political or Human Side Of The Challenge and I think
00:37:50 [W] Organizations look for the size and culture of a company will determine which is you know, the bigger challenge at hand.
00:38:06 [W] So things like this CK a decertification really help with Bridging the technology grab really help with like creating a momentum in terms like at the Grassroots level at the same
00:38:13 [W] It's extremely important for the leadership the technical leadership in these companies do start like, you know, looking at examples talking to other end users to just understand what's happened for other people and design their own Journey forward
00:38:29 [W] Truly a special Snowflake and and the good news is that with the kubernative becoming boring that the the special snowflake part is getting less and less in the like, you know, there's less less of the
00:38:45 [W] But you have a larger Community to rely on.
00:38:56 [W] So what we see in our end user Community, which I feel a little braggy but I'll say there is with 144 members. It's like the largest any foundation open source foundation and Joy's we have these end-user only
00:39:03 [W] Largest any foundation open source foundation and Joy's we have these end-user only meetings and things where people are coming together talking about specific challenges and that I think is invaluable.
00:39:12 [W] They have this safe space or there. No vendors have nothing against lenders, but it's a nice safe space for the end users and the conversations. I hear are increasingly more complex from the time.
00:39:24 [W] I joined Cloud native in 2016 as a part of the opentracing project to now
00:39:27 [W] Now in 2020 people have movie Leaps and Bounds and that's a testament to their commitment to build better software faster and more. Reliably Patrick.
00:39:40 [W] What are the roles of you're seeing are needed to be filled as we start to see more data on kubernative eyes as data on kubernative becomes, you know more comment, you know, as people are building out
00:39:52 [W] Patrick what are the roles that you're seeing are needed to be filled as we start to see more data on kubernative eyes as data on kubernative becomes, you know more comment,
00:39:54 [W] Well, I mean I the role that I that I really love right now is the s.res the site reliability Engineers.
00:40:08 [W] They're they're really responsible for the stack and their the unsung heroes of anything at scale at this point.
00:40:10 [W] so huge shout-out to my Sr. He's out there and I think that's that's a growing field because as we build out more expertise and infrastructure and scale infrastructure, and we reduced it the surface area of
00:40:25 [W] Ian the getting down into the weeds. I mean how many of us is set up a kernel driver on a Linux server?
00:40:32 [W] Not too many anymore, right?
00:40:37 [W] That's just not a thing that we're doing but s res are I think is the role of a council young people all the time is if you're interested in infrastructure learn how to code first then look at
00:40:47 [W] Sorry, because that is the future bill.
00:40:56 [W] Yeah, I think overall in terms of just not scaling out the infrastructure we're talking about how do we scale our individuals to be able to do more?
00:41:04 [W] So when we're talking about these as res and what maybe was an infrastructure admin in the past we're talking about a much lower ratio in terms of how many developers are actually being supported by an individual s re in today's world.
00:41:14 [W] So there might be only a team of 10 s res that's supporting a complete Enterprise environment.
00:41:18 [W] So really when we talk about scale, we're not just talking about it from a technology perspective.
00:41:23 [W] We're talking about it from a cultural perspective.
00:41:28 [W] We're talking about it from the underlying automation that has to happen in order to manage all of these different things that are running in a highly highly complex environment.
00:41:39 [W] So it is a dramatic culture shift and I think that that's when you talk about what needs to come first is you need to have that Visionary you need to have that person that said the way we're doing things today or yesterday is no longer going to work for our business and we need to think about things differently. We need to not go
00:41:48 [W] Do these manual efforts?
00:41:50 [W] We need to start thinking about how do we do that thing again?
00:41:56 [W] But in an automated process manner money to finish it up.
00:41:56 [W] Yeah, so I'm a big believer that kubernative has created a parallel ecosystem and parallel universe.
00:42:06 [W] So really when we talk about scale, we're not just talking about it from a technology perspective.
00:42:17 [W] We're talking about it from a cultural perspective.
00:42:18 [W] We're talking about it from the underlying automation that has to happen in order to manage all of these different things that are running in a highly highly complex environment.
00:42:20 [W] So it is a dramatic culture shift and I think that that's when you talk about what needs to come first is you need to have that Visionary you need to have that person that said the way we're doing things today or yesterday is no longer going to work for our business and we need to think about things differently. We need to not go
00:42:23 [W] go and do these manual efforts we need to start thinking about how do we do that thing again?
00:42:26 [W] But in an automated process manner money to finish it up.
00:42:28 [W] Yeah, so I'm a big believer that kubernative has created a parallel ecosystem and parallel universe.
00:42:30 [W] So currently we have this broad umbrella that says kubernative sadness traitor, but what I actually think is given the complexity and the growing importance of various building blocks within the comments ecosystem, right?
00:42:37 [W] It is Network whether it is storage whether it is security or release management, we are going to see the counter parts of the traditional administrative roles in the in the cloud knative ecosystem.
00:42:44 [W] So I think a year from now we'll actually see job titles that will say cloud native storage operations professional.
00:42:45 [W] No storage Ops is a big deal and again an average developer or a kubernative - traitor cannot deal with complex. Cri-o.
00:42:47 [W] And I based networks like Calico. So you need a cloud native network engineer and then you know, you have S res who will cover the entire spectrum and we're going to have highly focused specialized epsagon UPS
00:43:02 [W] Whether it is Network, whether it is storage with it is security or release management.
00:43:03 [W] We are going to see the counter parts of the traditional administrative roles in the in the cloud native ecosystem.
00:43:04 [W] So I think a year from now we'll actually see job titles that will say cloud native storage operations professional no storage options the big deal and again an average developer or a kubernative said Miss traitor cannot deal
00:43:05 [W] As I read today is like a very broad term that basically doing everything that they can but eventually we're going to have very specialized roles and job functions and definitions that will bring laser focus to the building blocks of kubernative stackrox.
00:43:19 [W] That's that's where we are headed to.
00:43:21 [W] This has been really great.
00:43:24 [W] Thank you all for participating today and for our virtual pancake breakfast.
00:43:32 [W] I hope we get to meet soon over real pancakes.
00:43:34 [W] That would be nice.
00:43:37 [W] I think that day will come again.
00:43:41 [W] But for now thank you so much for joining us Priyanka Sharma general manager of the cncf. It's great to have you on board there.
00:43:50 [W] It's really nice to see you in this role. We've always been big fans.
00:43:52 [W] Your work so congratulations and look forward to your leadership.
00:44:07 [W] Johnny Kara Johnny is the author of our ebook of the second edition another Shameless plug for our kubernative Z, but Johnny is such an authority in this space and is just one of the people who we've known for years and really just
00:44:11 [W] And Patrick McFadden Chief evangelist for Apache Cassandra. Datastax.
00:44:20 [W] Patrick's been fun. Getting to know you over the past few months in these recordings and look forward to our next discussions in person at some point and Bill's a jack have mean automation automation automation.
00:44:32 [W] That is the that's a theme.
00:44:34 [W] I keep hearing from bills today. So nice work their bills Regional director of solutions engineering at dynatrace.
00:44:39 [W] Thanks. Everyone participating questions. You can ask your questions.
00:44:41 [W] Here we have about 10 minutes for questions.
00:44:46 [W] So go right ahead and ask away.
00:44:47 [W] Thank you very much.
00:44:48 [W] Bye bye.
00:44:49 [W] Well, we're getting lots of questions here about terraform and so Patrick.
00:45:07 [W] You have lit up a discussion here. People are saying what's up with Terror for?
00:45:14 [W] Richard Richard kucera says, why would I need to learn terraform if I have our ke+ the future terraform in these types of tools Patrick?
00:45:30 [W] an initiative so overall I would look at it as a build versus maintain type of mindset where in the past you would have almost the same tooling puppet Chef terraform do both not only do the initial deployment of the new infrastructure piece inside the
00:45:56 [W] Have almost the same tooling puppet Chef terraform do both not only do the initial deployment of the new infrastructure piece inside the environment, but then also do that iterative changes of what's going on new patches or whatever might be needed.
00:46:02 [W] We do that iterative changes of what's going on do patches or whatever might be needed.
00:46:04 [W] But now we have this New Concept inside of kubernative.
00:46:12 [W] He's called an operator and it can actually take a look at what's happening inside of the environment and more of a real-time State and make changes that are based off of these different initiative or different needs.
00:46:20 [W] So we're you still have that initial build phase of when you're scaling out the cluster terraform still a great fit and you can still have your standard that would being added into the cluster but as you're talking about making those
00:46:27 [W] More integral changes inside of the environment where used to be handled by the same tooling now, we've abstracted it over to something like an operator.
00:46:35 [W] Okay, I'm going together.
00:46:40 [W] We're trapped.
00:46:40 [W] Yeah, right.
00:46:45 [W] Yeah, it's Patrick I think is not Patrick here.
00:46:46 [W] It's you Bill and Bill.
00:46:48 [W] and Bill. Thank you for that answer there Cheryl. I want to ask just a question when one person asked they said
00:46:56 [W] let me find it here.
00:47:00 [W] They were asking about what what are you looking forward to are there any sessions in particular that you're looking forward to?
00:47:13 [W] Is there a session you're looking forward to Cheryl and particular on a particular topic?
00:47:14 [W] Hey Alex, and thank you.
00:47:18 [W] I'm standing in for Priyanka today.
00:47:21 [W] So I am Cheryl.
00:47:23 [W] I'm the VP of ecosystem at cncf.
00:47:27 [W] Strangely enough.
00:47:31 [W] Cheryl I want to ask just a question when one person asked they said
00:47:33 [W] Let me find it here.
00:47:33 [W] They were asking about what what are you looking forward to are there any sessions in particular that you're looking forward to?
00:47:35 [W] Is there a session you're looking forward to Cheryl and particular on a particular topic?
00:47:35 [W] Hey Alex, and thank you.
00:47:35 [W] I'm standing in for Priyanka today.
00:47:36 [W] So I am Cheryl.
00:47:36 [W] I'm the VP of ecosystem at cncf.
00:47:36 [W] Strangely enough.
00:47:37 [W] I'm kind of nervous about my own Keynotes.
00:47:37 [W] I'm more nervous about this watching it through virtual coupon. Then I am doing it live. So when that's done, then I'll have a better answer of what else I want to see what other sessions.
00:47:45 [W] I'd say that's a good plan, but good point good.
00:47:49 [W] Good luck with that.
00:47:49 [W] I'm sure it's going to be awesome.
00:47:51 [W] I did I did note some of the end-user discussions that are planned for the conference.
00:48:05 [W] And so I'm looking forward to seeing some of those anyone else have any kind of Topic in particular that they're looking at Johnny or Bill.
00:48:10 [W] Johnny yeah, Alex.
00:48:25 [W] I'm actually looking forward to attending the containerd a hosted by AWS.
00:48:26 [W] There's only cover content including security.
00:48:30 [W] Okay, cool bill.
00:48:33 [W] I honestly it's going to be looking at the schedule right now.
00:48:44 [W] I think there's just so many different things that Michael calendars blocked off. So
00:48:46 [W] All right.
00:48:51 [W] Let me ask another question that I want to bring this over to Johnny.
00:48:52 [W] There's a question here about about
00:48:57 [W] There's two questions.
00:48:59 [W] Dolph
00:49:03 [W] all right.
00:49:03 [W] Well, let me ask another question then I want to bring this over to Johnny.
00:49:03 [W] There's a question here about about
00:49:03 [W] these two questions. I wanted to ask first of all, what about Federation?
00:49:05 [W] And Johnny?
00:49:09 [W] I know you talked about these Management Services in your discussion and Deepak coach says he wants to wants to know more about kubernative Federation.
00:49:20 [W] What are the resources you're looking to for learning about Federation and what are some of the things that you are looking?
00:49:26 [W] Or as cholesterol becomes more of a matter of concern.
00:49:33 [W] Yeah, good question.
00:49:40 [W] So a couple of years there was an effort that got started just called kubeflow egg.
00:49:47 [W] This was all about federating to clusters and deploying workloads.
00:49:50 [W] diverting the traffic and running multiple components multiple microservices across multiple clusters, but for some reasons Judo complexity and due to the the
00:50:05 [W] Kubernative ecosystem has evolved that didn't really take off.
00:50:10 [W] So the kubeflow project really didn't see a lot of momentum or lot of progress.
00:50:16 [W] Today Federation is taking place but not in the original form of cube Factor, but it is predominantly driven by the multi cluster control planes like like anthis and Rancher that I have talked about. So
00:50:32 [W] If you are looking at the traditional definition of kubernative federation, that is that hasn't moved much.
00:50:44 [W] There is not much progress there the kubeflow project but from a different perspective today, we are witnessing a lot of federation between on-prem clusters and cloud-based Custer's hybrid multi-cloud
00:50:56 [W] Is predominantly driven by The Meta control plane.
00:50:59 [W] Okay.
00:51:04 [W] Bill there is a there is a question about
00:51:10 [W] gitops and it was from comes from Phillip Stroh be says he says he's maintaining an open source. Terraform gitops framework called Cube stack.
00:51:23 [W] He wanted to know about gitops for automating clusters and not just application deployment.
00:51:30 [W] Have you studied this topic?
00:51:35 [W] And what's your perspective?
00:51:36 [W] Yeah, it's humans make mistakes.
00:51:40 [W] So everything has code and really having everything set up as a checkable repository. Even when we're talking about spinning up infrastructure is being up things that are deployment events, but aren't necessarily application deployment events.
00:51:54 [W] So I think overall history doesn't tend to kind of be invented. It just repeats itself. So in the past where we talked about lights out data centers were there was tooling that was managing the the health and well-being of the server's we see a lot of gitops.
00:52:07 [W] Tractus is doing very similar things.
00:52:10 [W] How do we control scaling events?
00:52:15 [W] How do we have systems of repositories for scripts to manage the complete environment as well?
00:52:22 [W] And we're talking about gitops and what's really there for overall everything as code.
00:52:27 [W] It's really having that set of standards that removes the human variability in a lot of these circumstances as well.
00:52:30 [W] Johnny would you like to respond to that at all?
00:52:40 [W] There's such a fever about gitops now.
00:52:40 [W] But I like so so gitops today is predominantly targeting the workload deployments it is it is basically bringing the desired set of configuration for deployments and for workloads from a
00:52:57 [W] Dell source of Truth which is which is the git repo but it is still pretty much confined to the applications and workloads.
00:53:12 [W] It hasn't gone to a point where you can you can spin up a cluster from the configuration stored in Detroit book.
00:53:18 [W] So I think that is the next step but currently the entire focus is around desired should configuration of deployments.
00:53:22 [W] Okay, excellent bill. There's a question about s res and and and the the person who asked the question of inkatha.
00:53:37 [W] asked or actually I don't know if I'm caught as a man or a woman in Vancouver been caught us a latesh gentle got a says along with Kate's what is considered as a good Tech stack for a rook esre to start with?
00:53:52 [W] There's a lot going on within the cncf and I think everything overall if we were to take a look at complete landscape has some components that can run Within kubernative.
00:54:08 [W] But I think one of the first things that I started looking into when I got my hands wet with kubernative was is co so being able to take a look at servicemeshcon seeing the inner workings of how the different components are actually working together.
00:54:18 [W] So I would highly recommend if you're just getting started with kubernative.
00:54:22 [W] He's and deploying your first clusters.
00:54:22 [W] Would be a good step 2 in my mind will start taking a look at this to and what it can do.
00:54:27 [W] Yes, or actually, I don't know if I'm caught as a man or a woman bent could been kind of salad atten. Tion all got a says along with Kate's what is considered as a good Tech stack for a rook esre to start with?
00:54:29 [W] There's a lot going on within the cncf and I think everything overall if we were to take a look at that complete landscape has some components that can run Within kubernative.
00:54:32 [W] But I think one of the first things that I started looking into when I got my hands wet with kubernative was is co so being able to take a look at servicemeshcon seeing the inner workings of how the different components are actually working together.
00:54:35 [W] So I would highly recommend if you're just getting started with kubernative and deploying your first clusters.
00:54:37 [W] Would be a good step 2 in my mind will start taking a look at this and what it can do.
00:54:39 [W] Great, I'm gonna finish it up with Cheryl Cheryl is the as the conference begins.
00:54:40 [W] What are these questions reflecting on for you about the event. There are questions here about terraform. There's questions about Federated clusters and I see two questions about

00:54:52 [W] I'm going to finish it up with Cheryl Cheryl is the as the conference begins.
00:54:52 [W] What are these questions reflecting on for you about the event. There are questions here about terraform. There's questions about Federated clusters and I see two questions about
00:54:53 [W] One question that we're get getting about the developer experience and I want to just maybe end it with you about that focus on the developer experience a big concern. I know among end-users.
00:55:09 [W] Absolutely, and in fact coming back to the whole question of this virtual pancake breakfast is kubernative boring.
00:55:24 [W] I think from these answers you're seeing the kubernetes has become the expected default. And now the question is more sophisticated, you know, it's gone beyond should I use kubernative or not?
00:55:35 [W] So for sure understanding the ride developer experience managing the
00:55:40 [W] A to operations gitops both for applications and for the cluster management itself.
00:55:52 [W] I think these are topics that are all going to reflect over the next few days and reflect how people are Thinking Beyond just you know, should I use kubenetes or not?
