00:03:31 [W] Hello everyone.
00:03:37 [W] My name is Bob Dylan. I am a
00:03:38 [W] Hello everyone.
00:08:44 [W] My name is Bob Dylan. I am a research clotted - traitor for the University of Michigan.
00:08:47 [W] And hit over where my name is Edward Rango.
00:08:53 [W] I'm a software engineer for red hat and we are here to present about the cncf research User Group.
00:08:59 [W] Next slide. So first I sort of want to get into why well with the people attending this talk, I don't think I should have to talk about two inch of these points but
00:09:17 [W] Edward arango I'm a software engineer for red hat and we are here to present about the cncf research User Group.
00:09:18 [W] Next slide. So first I sort of want to get into why well with the the people attending this talk, I don't think I actually have to talk about two inch of these points but
00:09:20 [W] Go system.
00:09:20 [W] We've seen an increased use of containers everywhere.
00:09:27 [W] And with that has come more complex workflows and not just for the research process itself, but with Enterprises and all sorts of groups sort of getting involved in things like she learning things like model life cycle are becoming much more important
00:09:37 [W] Riding on that we're seeing much more adoption of things like streaming data in a venting based on that data something that historically hasn't been done too much in the research field.
00:09:49 [W] Additionally, we're sort of seeing greater use of Interactive Science gateways these days people are just expecting to get something like a Jupiter notebook to interact with their data and sort of like Bap it backing those signs gateways and do streaming services.
00:10:05 [W] Persistent services that are needed to support them and all of these things actually lend themselves really well to kubernative.
00:10:21 [W] It gives us a platform agnostic API that aims AIDS in the scheduling in Mandarin of those different workloads.
00:10:23 [W] So
00:10:28 [W] why form a user group?
00:10:32 [W] Most research oriented like most research prodyna workloads are different.
00:10:44 [W] We are a also a much different from what you'd run in Enterprise.
00:10:45 [W] I'm sorry.
00:10:52 [W] We are a much smaller subset of users than those that are running Enterprise focused Services much of what we do is very sort of like a job or task focused with potentially hundreds of thousands of jobs akin to sort of
00:11:00 [W] Light running something like slurm.
00:11:12 [W] These are sort of also very resource intensive and you would know and you're like normal bin packing isn't necessarily going to be the best way of running those workloads.
00:11:17 [W] We also require more advanced scheduling than white green eyes can provide out of the box the best example of this being MPI or cording the scheduling of multiple pods to launch and run at the same time work arounds have sort of been developed
00:11:27 [W] Poor little communities like there's the MPI operator in kubeflow a very awesome up-and-coming project called Volcano That is a Sandbox project.
00:11:42 [W] You're sort of like several other little things that out there that's of rely on stateful sets to sort of do like offer that similar Behavior. Now MPI isn't the only thing many environments are large and actually require
00:11:52 [W] why on stateful sets of sort of do like offer that similar Behavior now MPI isn't the only thing many environments are large and actually require additional support for things like fair share cues and a host of other things
00:11:57 [W] Port for things like fair share cues and a host of other things when you're running on something like bare metal.
00:12:03 [W] And while these things haven't necessarily been forgotten by Upstream.
00:12:05 [W] They have largely been underrepresented.
00:12:06 [W] And I like that last word because also why to form our user group is to represent us all so that's what I like from the cloud native Foundation is we're creating this user group to share
00:12:22 [W] Points to have weekly or monthly meeting to say is not working for me is failing and I need some help and as Bob said this is a small user group and we need as much help as we can.
00:12:38 [W] So this is a group for sharing success histories like project volcano that but also toa's and out. The new ideas are coming from these small groups, and this is a common place so we can share and we
00:12:54 [W] We can request feedback from others in the same field trying to make research a little more Cloud native.
00:13:08 [W] And when I say this small groups, I mean like we have a small projects coming out of CERN like the latest HT Condor operator or the common workflow language now being able to interact with kubenetes
00:13:15 [W] Universities also joining puree. So it is growing we have some Enterprises universities and research institutes. Join and idea is so we can grow this into more people
00:13:31 [W] ideas among the same mindset
00:13:36 [W] So we've been involved with kubernetes for quite some time and I've been able to speak with a lot of research groups over the past few years many of these groups are grappling with the same set of problems and
00:13:55 [W] And workarounds in silos.
00:14:01 [W] There hasn't been sort of a strong unifying group to sort of help Drive the research Computing needs in the cloud native ecosystem that's sort of the real idea for this user group bringing the, you know, communities and groups that were to had just mentioned together.
00:14:13 [W] Be one unifying voice.
00:14:20 [W] Now there have been some various like Rumblings and efforts in the past boss actually sort of came to a head last year at keep counting you in Barcelona where a bunch of us also like met together over lunch for a few days and we
00:14:31 [W] Something happen and originally was going to be a Koreans working group. But over time it evolved into cncf into the cncf user group that it is today.
00:14:42 [W] And with that we sort of like over those, you know few lunches and later on some of the meetings. We identified some common themes.
00:14:59 [W] So some of the big things that stuck out is we don't actually really know who's all doing a research on kubernative and what sort of research they're doing.
00:15:04 [W] Everyone's sort of feels like they're off on their own in the dark and sort of seconding that there isn't really a good set of best practices for operating like large clusters or clusters that are in, Tennessee.
00:15:13 [W] Large amount of jobs the defaults don't support an environment with a larger like a large amount of turn as well. Now the thing is like Curious itself out of the box doesn't support running workloads like MPI.
00:15:28 [W] The base batch capabilities are kind of lacking there and while there are sort of like other things like there's there's multiple multi cluster tools out there most don't lend themselves to the distribution of jobs.
00:15:44 [W] They lend themselves to the distribution of like your standard application type deployments.
00:15:54 [W] They're very sort of focused on ensuring that you know, sort of like X number of deployments are across multiple clusters. Not X number of jobs are spread evenly across the
00:15:59 [W] um, all the other thing is multi-tenancy itself is also a problem.
00:16:11 [W] Grace isn't really like your sort of standard HPC environment where everyone has a posix identity you're now dealing with application identity.
00:16:14 [W] And these are just a few of the common themes.
00:16:18 [W] We've seen what that we actually decided to start a few initiatives.
00:16:19 [W] So let's talk about the initiatives are have come from the researcher cgroup.
00:16:32 [W] So right now we want to highlight these three main initiative the first one as I was talking about communities.
00:16:34 [W] We want to know how big this community can be and we want to know who is using your Nettie's who is using kubenetes and Cloud native tools overall for research.
00:16:49 [W] So at the end of this presentation, we have some links and we are asking everyone to go into those links and Fields.
00:16:51 [W] aaniin whole have deployed what and where so we want to hear if you are running research on bare metal if you're running research on the cloud if you're doing something hybrid, so we want to know that and
00:17:14 [W] Running research on the cloud if you are doing something hybrid, so we want to know that and we are asking everyone to feel this survey.
00:17:19 [W] We also have this index and we went to we're already seeing this of awesome list as every solution right now has awesome.
00:17:27 [W] Ladies and I remember my face also lays was awesome containers.
00:17:33 [W] I remember now and we want to have this awesome list of projects that can help other researchers to
00:17:38 [W] Get the their job done because at the end of that's the main of the of these User Group some random researcher in a random Research Institute.
00:17:52 [W] Just Community this group getting help getting his research Zone saving the war from what's coming and a researcher can save us and we want to create this awesome leave so they can find things easier and also the one of
00:18:03 [W] One of the good ideas that is coming from this initiative is the book of best practices. And as Bob said, there are a lot of things that are not out of the blue for kubernative and we want to write this guideline for
00:18:19 [W] four common topics and user stories best practices in
00:18:24 [W] things that can help from the system admin to the research user to use cloud native tools to get research time.
00:18:33 [W] So the cognitive research workloads book really wants to Target system admins operator research software engineers and research support staff.
00:18:50 [W] So kind of like in where we are right now that we don't say system that means anymore.
00:18:58 [W] it evolved from system that I mean to the devops guy to the operator guy. Now we say sorry, but it's kind of part to the guy that is dealing with all the issues the sysdig.
00:19:05 [W] That means we want to write this guideline with user stories with pain points.
00:19:13 [W] I was sitting in the previous slide and really take down from day 1 to day x what you should be doing with your cure Nettie's deployment and how to operate that in a good way so you don't
00:19:26 [W] To the researchers workloads, right like interrupting runs and executions and also protecting data because that's something that is very hard as Bob was saying the multi-tenancy and research environments
00:19:41 [W] Need to be thinking that research a is not deleting or reading information from researcher be and we want to make research Cloud native with this book when we say this is I personally
00:19:57 [W] Community to help researchers teachers and students to get things done faster easier and in a better way, so if we can help researchers teachers to get things done with containers and have fun as
00:20:13 [W] Having fun making things boring and if those things are boring, so they're researching and teacher can just use it as a tool and have that as a guideline in a book that that is going to be a nurse from Project.
00:20:29 [W] So cluster operations the topics we want to Torres in this book is configuration management and cluster life cycle.
00:20:45 [W] So which things to install from day one how to operate them how to update them how to upgrade them how to delete then if you don't need anymore.
00:20:53 [W] So the life cycle of an application in top on top of your communities closer. We want to write that down as a guideline management of closures and top of openstack. So a lot of research
00:21:02 [W] Institutions are right now using openstack integration with parallel HPC file system and access management.
00:21:11 [W] So it get very important when you start talking about like NPI and things like that.
00:21:17 [W] How can you make your cure net is cluster interact via our DNA's and be a specialized Hardware. So here we are not talking about software, but Hardware, how can you enabled data specialized Hardware to your your net is cluster
00:21:27 [W] Gpus your kubenetes closer in a good way and manage large escaped krauser. I like 1,000 nodes in just so everyone in this Cloud native Community can make sense of numbers in
00:21:42 [W] That research facility of a specie 1,000 nodes is really just the login node.
00:21:54 [W] So in rhpc situation you start talking about 10,000 nodes twenty thousand nodes and that is considered like a middle kind of Sighs Edge PC deployment.
00:22:04 [W] 1,000 nodes is really the login system.
00:22:06 [W] So configuration management. There are some things that I was discussing with Bob before this presentation.
00:22:27 [W] What tooling work went provisioning nodes is really not that easy to solve your head. He's in a bare metal structure is not like when you request to your cloud provider a give me a cure and a disclosure.
00:22:34 [W] He's my credit card and you get a coupon at least cluster running and some dollars let on your credit card, but
00:22:41 [W] How to do that in your own cluster in your own systems is not that easy.
00:22:50 [W] So what tool in to use and how to use it because you can use different tools.
00:22:53 [W] that is not that's under how to use them how its intent occation manage and for me this is very important like authentication and also the security policies for multi-user multi-tenant on
00:23:05 [W] Bad how to do that in your own cluster in your own systems is not that easy.
00:23:06 [W] So what tooling to use and how to use it because you can use different tools.
00:23:07 [W] that is not that's under how to use them how its intent occation manage and for me this is very important like authentication and also the security policies for multi-user multi-tenant on
00:23:08 [W] Parish cluster
00:23:09 [W] because it gets very messy in multi-tenant environments.
00:23:14 [W] So we need to be able to differentiate users projects.
00:23:19 [W] I user can be in different projects.
00:23:21 [W] Like let's say a professor or teacher can be in different projects.
00:23:25 [W] So he has access to different kind of data. But also there are some researchers that can only read one specific side of the data.
00:23:33 [W] So we need to be able to separate that and there are some things that are right now in place internet is but we want also to be
00:23:38 [W] Go to propose things are doesn't exist yet and how to do that do them in a good way.
00:23:45 [W] Openstack in parallel file system again. We want to write in this book all the good practices guidelines on how to deploy your kernel is closer in on top of a running openstack installation. Like
00:24:02 [W] Into how to drawn and deploy openstack that there are books for that.
00:24:12 [W] We're running from you have a open Stock running you already read it or your openstack books. And this is an extra book on top of those open stack books that you're going to read on how to if you have openstack now, how
00:24:22 [W] Ironic to deploy a bare-metal provision in how to you can integrate with other tools in the ecosystem to put your culinary skills are on top of openstack.
00:24:37 [W] Also how to do parallel file systems in the way HPC system ecosystem doesn't now in a cloud native way. So we want to Route these guidelines in this book.
00:24:48 [W] Gpus, this is one of my favorite topics.
00:24:58 [W] I am part of the GPU operator and I maintain how to run gpus for red hat.
00:25:04 [W] So I'm very passionate about this and writing guidelines and a book about how to do. This is very important and then helping researchers to enable their gpus and new and shiny and
00:25:15 [W] Or if you are in the AMD ecosystem how to do that also.
00:25:29 [W] So these guidelines are going to help from the cistern and mean s res to the researchers to expose a new and shiny gpus.
00:25:33 [W] gpus. So then they can run kubeflow or a IML research on top of those GPS.
00:25:36 [W] But okay that's very kicks over to the other side of the coin the not the people necessarily running the Clusters put the people consuming them in your researchers your teachers or students.
00:25:52 [W] This might also eventually be like other Enterprise type customers that are looking at dashboard for report on something but with all that we sort of identified a few big key areas one Jupiter Hub,
00:26:05 [W] Number one requested application superhub is coming deployed at most research sites and it's quickly becoming sort of the de facto standard for ways to people to sort of like consume the stuff especially on top of kubernative now.
00:26:21 [W] There have been some issues in the past there continues to be some problems specifically around like user identity management.
00:26:33 [W] How do I plug into my you know active directory or ldap and you know provision a pod as that user that can actually translate to a posix identity for that person to communicate
00:26:43 [W] Managed file services. So there have been a lot of issues especially with trying to you know, integrate with Kerberos and like Canada and things of that nature.
00:26:58 [W] There's also been things like image management problems where you might have a whole slew of different images for different classes and different people to consume.
00:27:02 [W] next sort of building on top of your Hub a little bit is actually kubeflow and machine learning this our lifecycle management and just as like Trooper help us sort of become the standard for things kubeflow is quickly
00:27:18 [W] Go to four things specifically related to machine learning and machine learning lifecycle management.
00:27:28 [W] It is actually a sort of large collection of tools that have all been bundled together and like integrate really really well with each other.
00:27:37 [W] The kubeflow team has done a incredible job with that and you know, the the one thing that's a little bit lacking is like there's a lot of people are gaping going but the best practices around and said don't you know quite exist quite yet.
00:27:49 [W] And there's sort of like some other little aspects of it like it is possible to make it multi-tenant. But it you know the stories around and people actually doing it multi-tenant is I'll say a little bit lacking.
00:28:04 [W] there's people are still like off in the dark trying to do it themselves. The other thing in you heard me sort of like touch upon this earlier is like batch Computing and MPI. These things are not supported by current is by default, but there are
00:28:21 [W] Rules out there that do enable that for kubernative.
00:28:25 [W] He's the big one.
00:28:29 [W] Do you happen to see me talk about stuff before you've probably heard me reference volcano a cncf Sandbox project that is bringing the sort of like classic batch Computing style things to kubernative that
00:28:40 [W] Like cues backfill and all things that you would find in a classic environment, okay.
00:28:50 [W] The next thing is sort of the various like workflow engine and gitops there. This is a very large ecosystem with a whole slew of different tools.
00:29:06 [W] Probably one of the most common ones out there these days is Argo and it's actually used by like kubeflow under the hood, but you know, it's not the only one out there.
00:29:11 [W] There are many others out there and some general guidance around, you know, what tools exist and how to use them would be very useful the other thing and after talking for some time.
00:29:21 [W] We had originally like lumped in gitops in with sort of like workflow engine since they are sort of, you know have a very close relationship with each other, but it's now a large enough topic where it will probably be spun off into its own chapter and actually a
00:29:36 [W] would be very useful the other thing and after talking for some time we had originally like lumped in gitops in with sort of like workflow engine since they are sort of, you know have a very close relationship with each other, but it's now a large enough topic
00:29:38 [W] Of paper where we will probably see a lot more results from that and over the timeline for it, but sometime soon.
00:29:51 [W] So how the like we want to answer these questions on how researchers can like effectively used gitops.
00:29:59 [W] We've seen, you know, what storing everything and get has done for, you know, the management of sort of Enterprise applications and being able to tie, you know, what iteration of a model to the code to the data?
00:30:07 [W] That was run to you like produce the result and we've seen how useful it is now.
00:30:16 [W] We just need to sort of like right a little bit of how more people can do it.
00:30:19 [W] Lastly.
00:30:25 [W] We sort of have the concept of like data Ops and this sort of you know, all these things sort of like work off each other and integrate with each other but like managing data and sort of a cloud native layer cloudevents varmint is fundamentally different from your classic HPC system.
00:30:34 [W] More HPC system where you have that parallel file system and everything has a posix identity where everyone's logging into like a login node that doesn't really exist in a traditional way in sort of the cloud need of space.
00:30:49 [W] So this might be you know, shifting more people to learn to use like object storage.
00:30:53 [W] Or you know being able to use something like x f to build a mount certain things up to different places and the other thing is like how do we sort of store and look at this data and Save in a way that's accessible through like, you know, the workflow engines and
00:31:09 [W] Things up to different places and the other thing is like how do we sort of store and look at this data and Save in a way that's accessible through like, you know, the workflow engines and all that other fun stuff.
00:31:13 [W] So with that we sort of covered a little bit of of what the group is and what we're trying to do and how important like, you know, this book is
00:31:24 [W] and what we would really like from you is to you sort of go and visit some of the stuff we were talking about earlier so you can help us by going to like the the cncf research User Group repo and fill out the site survey if
00:31:39 [W] Really like from you is to you sort of go and visit some of the stuff we were talking about earlier so you can help us by going to like the the cncf research User Group repo and fill out the site survey if you have a really useful resource.
00:31:44 [W] Really useful resource on you know how to do something. Please just like PR it into the like our awesome list.
00:31:47 [W] It's super helpful.
00:31:54 [W] The other thing is like we have some people have already sort of volunteered to help us with the various chapters in this book.
00:32:00 [W] We still have a lot of sections that haven't been claimed. If you are a subject matter expert in any of the space, please just go and like, you know volunteer reach out to you know, one of us, I'm like the mailing list and will like any feedback or information on the stuff would be incredibly
00:32:13 [W] we appreciate it would be a should greatly.
00:32:14 [W] With that here's a little bit of where to find us.
00:32:22 [W] We have the the GitHub repo that's of like our central place of tracking everything and then the are cncf mailing list.
00:32:28 [W] We have two meetings a month the first Wednesday of the month at 11:00 a.m.
00:32:31 [W] CT.
00:32:34 [W] That's the more you friendly meeting and then the third Wednesday of the month at 5 p.m. CET, which is the more, you know, America's from friendly meeting.
00:32:42 [W] And with that I think we will call it there and now go over to the Q&A that's in like a month.
00:32:52 [W] Decided that comes you want to say.
00:32:56 [W] No, it's okay.
00:33:02 [W] I really want to read the Q&A and instead of growing the community.
00:33:03 [W] Okay.
00:33:05 [W] Well then we'll talk to you in a few.
00:33:07 [W] America's from friendly meeting and with that I think we will call it there and now go over to the Q&A that's in like a month decided that comes
00:33:16 [W] I have a big one month after yep. That was a nice for the recording.
00:33:25 [W] So for everyone here, I just paste it like all the links on the presentation on this lack channel. So that way you don't have to be asking around like where are the slides right in click on the links.
00:33:41 [W] The links are already in the slack in the tread on Cube come maintainer.
00:33:47 [W] you look for the Trader, you will see the links should be in. Yeah us too - Keep Calm - maintainer.
00:33:56 [W] That doesn't look like there's any questions queued up.
00:34:08 [W] But if anyone like to sort of like pick our brains are doing like that be happy to do it here pick up over in Slack.
00:34:14 [W] Comparison to using over containers running set for object storage.
00:34:54 [W] So at least with with kubernetes where some of that stuff comes in is if you're using something say Rook where you sort of have this fully integrated system of being able to manage everything through sort of one
00:35:12 [W] It also sort of does a really nice job of automatically presenting itself as something that can be consumed within a kubernative cluster.
00:35:24 [W] Looks like there's some more follow-up stuff.
00:35:34 [W] They're looking mainly 40 petabytes of weather data.
00:35:35 [W] I think I would personally fall back to rook and managing. The object storage would be fairly similar.
00:35:47 [W] It's just you'd be sort of managing it all in one place.
00:35:53 [W] Does that sort of answer your question?
00:35:54 [W] So the second question is the we propose created cure net extensions.
00:36:04 [W] I wouldn't say like we as a group do that is more of you can come here with your experiences and you're creating something and you want some feedback from the end users
00:36:17 [W] Mm, you're creating something and you want some feedback from the end users itself or maintainers and we can share up and talk about that like so far.
00:36:26 [W] We haven't created proposed extensions for kubernative from the group. But I feel like right now is just place a common ground for sharing feedback on new ideas or new project like this project volcano
00:36:39 [W] Grow from the researcher should group but it's of course something that we discuss like you on a daily basis because it's very important for researchers how to bash and how to share with us.
00:36:55 [W] see
00:37:00 [W] well other side like that one see how
00:37:08 [W] Sorry, I was going to read there and just a random researcher.
00:37:13 [W] Hey, this is about end users and organizations like please if you are using
00:37:19 [W] Any sort of cloud native Technologies not just cure Nares to get done your research. Please come and tell us what are you doing?
00:37:30 [W] Continue scrolling down.
00:37:39 [W] So we're working on Frederick ostrich feather in machine learning.
00:37:46 [W] So Federation and things like that is probably the big topic going on right now. There isn't sort of a
00:37:52 [W] A clear sort of winner or pattern on that yet. Some things are being built better to support it.
00:38:00 [W] So I believe kubeflow has some sto integration.
00:38:09 [W] The or support at least like multi cluster.
00:38:18 [W] There are some other things that are starting to support better multi-tenancy like the hierarchical namespace controller a blog post was dropped just the other day about that where you finally answered.
00:38:29 [W] Yeah, there have been several projects that sort of started to try and cover that in the research space one was I was
00:38:40 [W] Associated with was a little bit called slate. And another was that what was what was the one started in San Diego? Remember where as one giant stretch cluster?
00:38:52 [W] No, so many names.
00:38:58 [W] No, I'm totally I'm totally blanking out on it. But I will PRP The PRP Pacific like research platform.
00:39:08 [W] I think that was it.
00:39:11 [W] Well, you have a good memory.
00:39:16 [W] Let's see.
00:39:19 [W] I'm totally I'm totally blanking out on it. But I will PRP The PRP Pacific like research platform.
00:39:41 [W] I think that was it.
00:39:41 [W] Well, you have a good memory.
00:39:42 [W] Let's see.
00:39:42 [W] And so one of the least with the book and some of the things of that one of the big contributors for that is CERN who is a very large openstack contributor and there are sort of really building out the best practices and
00:39:45 [W] Really building out the best practices and sort of learning as they go along when it comes to doing that sort of thing.
00:39:53 [W] They were also really large proponents of kubeflow Ed.
00:39:57 [W] Let's keep everyone back when they were doing Federated work with that.
00:39:58 [W] I don't know what their current status is on that the person that to give a poke would be Ricardo Roca who is also on the mailing list.
00:40:10 [W] Are there any other questions?
00:40:24 [W] Looks like there are lots of universities and Federal grant researchers looking at.
00:40:49 [W] So the QA it does isn't necessarily the it's kind of difficult to follow chats are conversations.
00:40:59 [W] Oh nice, you're using someone is using Pachyderm.
00:41:06 [W] Let's see.
00:41:07 [W] Any other questions?
00:41:16 [W] Looks like if you are lots of universities in federal court researchers looking at so the QA it does isn't necessary the it's kind of difficult to follow chats
00:41:18 [W] That they have actually been looking for end-users to bring up their use cases.
00:41:24 [W] To sort of build something up better.
00:41:32 [W] Oh, I'm a header up here moment. One of the other active groups that's participating in the research User Group G research developed a Federated sort of job submission system
00:41:43 [W] You said believe? I don't know if it's the term they're going live with for it. But the project was called Armada. If you go through our meeting notes, you should be able to find something about it.
00:41:57 [W] I would love to hear more about the Pachyderm for that I Version Control at we are about to run out of time.
00:42:11 [W] So if you can chat with me over the lack of guilt, I would love to because as Bob said in the presentation, I'm working on Kato, ah academic paper on gitops and Version
00:42:24 [W] Or academic usage of chlorinated tools. So please do so to keep this going you pop over to it's the channel to - Keep Calm - maintainer and there's a thread specifically for our section.
00:42:39 [W] Kill it there.
00:42:43 [W] So that take care everyone and I'll see you all in Slack.
