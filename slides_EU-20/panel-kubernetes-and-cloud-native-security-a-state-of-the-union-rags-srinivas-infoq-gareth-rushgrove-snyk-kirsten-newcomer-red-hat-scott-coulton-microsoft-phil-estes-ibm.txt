00:03:16 [W] Hello and welcome everyone by name.
00:03:25 [W] My name is Rahman shrinivas.
00:03:30 [W] Good morning, and good afternoon or good evening from wherever you joining.
00:03:40 [W] appreciate it.
00:03:42 [W] So this is a panel on kubernative security and you know Cloud native security.
00:03:51 [W] There is a perception out there. Unfortunately that kubenetes security is insecure by default, but I have a panel in August panel really, you know the first time
00:04:02 [W] Doing a panel in August and there is an August panel joining from every part of the world.
00:04:08 [W] I'd like to welcome them first and and then, you know, I'll let them introduce themselves.
00:04:17 [W] And in the meantime, for those of you who have joined this panel, I'd appreciate if you can use the Q&A box, you know to queue up the questions. You can start queuing at cuing them up right now
00:04:29 [W] No, start prioritizing them. If you have a question to a particular speaker, you know, feel free to do that, you know our to a particular company that's represented to the panel that we work as well and if you can
00:04:44 [W] You know, I know this is we are times where we are doing this online.
00:04:50 [W] It's hard to come back and ask clarifying questions.
00:04:54 [W] So if you can provide as much context as possible, that would be great.
00:04:59 [W] I have a set of questions that I have queued up. But what I'm going to do here is you know, hope that you the attendees will be asking the questions and I don't
00:05:09 [W] To fall into my bank. So with that said, let me do a quick intro of myself.
00:05:15 [W] My name is raghav and shrinivas and I am a developer myself. I come from really the Java and the cloud Foundry background and I just want things to work.
00:05:29 [W] I am a big fan of kind of seeing, you know applications being stood up easily big fan of Frameworks like draft and scaffold and things like that, which makes it kind of approach the same philosophy that cloud Foundry has
00:05:43 [W] with that
00:05:44 [W] Let me pass the Baton on to the next panelist.
00:05:48 [W] Hi Oscar coltd there.
00:05:58 [W] I am I'm Scott Carlton.
00:05:59 [W] I'm actually in Sydney at the moment.
00:06:02 [W] So fun fact it's quarter to 2:00 a.m.
00:06:02 [W] In the morning.
00:06:11 [W] I work for Microsoft and the developer Levesque containers and my interest is everything to do with like runtimes and keeping it he's secured. So that's what I mostly Focus everything all my efforts
00:06:17 [W] Perfect.
00:06:21 [W] women on
00:06:24 [W] Garrett you there?
00:06:32 [W] Okay, we'll come back to Garrett.
00:06:39 [W] think I think I'm here now.
00:06:39 [W] Okay, no worries.
00:06:42 [W] All right. Yeah. All right. Yeah, I'm guys are stove.
00:06:53 [W] I'm director of product data security company called sneak and also one of the maintainers on the open policy agent project specifically around contest which is a little test security testing tool I wrote a while ago.
00:07:00 [W] perfect moving on Kirsten
00:07:06 [W] Hi folks, Kirsten newcomer with red hat.
00:07:17 [W] My focus is Security in the openshift stack and red hat and really for for me. That means security throughout the stack from the operating system through kubernative stew the app Dev Solutions, and I have a particular interest
00:07:26 [W] Gasps My rolls kind of throughout my career have included sysadmin roles QE product management program management, really enjoying working in the kubernetes the
00:07:41 [W] Active management program management really enjoying working in the kubernetes the containers and coops security space.
00:07:44 [W] Perfect.
00:07:49 [W] Let me take a moment to remind attendees again to queuing questions.
00:07:55 [W] I don't think I see too many so, you know rather than fall back into my question bank.
00:08:05 [W] I really would appreciate if you you know can cue up the questions so that we are ready to go as soon as the intros are done.
00:08:16 [W] Otherwise, like I said, you know, I have a bank but but I am hoping that I'll get some questions which that said.
00:08:18 [W] Thank you. Kristen moving on to fill.
00:08:19 [W] Hey everybody, Phil Estes our work for IBM Cloud.
00:08:28 [W] I've had pretty significant involvement in the container runtime space for the last five plus years working on Docker and containerd E and the oci on behalf of IBM cloud and more recently.
00:08:43 [W] gotten deep more deeply involved in our iOS platform stackrox o that now includes the operating system below.
00:08:51 [W] Supervisor layer and so I'm very interested in everything from like like Kristen said supply chain security the operating system the the core components at the runtime layer up through the kubernative stackrox.
00:09:08 [W] Involvement in the container runtime space for the last five plus years working on Docker and containerd E and the oci on behalf of IBM cloud and more recently.
00:09:13 [W] I've gotten deep more deeply involved in our iOS platform stackrox o that now includes the operating system below hypervisor layer. And so I'm very interested in everything from like like Christian said
00:09:14 [W] Perfect.
00:09:16 [W] We have a fairly lengthy question here.
00:09:19 [W] I see some overlap between operations.
00:09:20 [W] I'm going to try to make it public.
00:09:22 [W] and
00:09:29 [W] some overlap between operations admin running Cube cartel versus doors running application command.
00:09:40 [W] And hence. We are running into these roles profiles configurations even more complex for operation Edmonds.
00:09:45 [W] Is it okay to reuse kubernative are back even for my application CLI to keep it simple Also.
00:09:54 [W] Let's have complexity in configuring roles in profiles only at one place that you'll fly.
00:09:58 [W] What is your opinion on this?
00:10:00 [W] Let's start with Phil since he
00:10:01 [W] He was on just now Phil.
00:10:04 [W] Do you want to take this?
00:10:05 [W] You give me a tricky one.
00:10:10 [W] Yeah, I first.
00:10:14 [W] I don't know if anyone understands the question better than I do. I think I'm understanding that.
00:10:22 [W] This is more about that line between Ops and sort of a developer dealing with application layer on top of sort of the kubernative control plane.
00:10:30 [W] So yeah, I don't know Kristen or Gareth may have better understanding of kind of that application layer and how that ties into the more kubernative control plane are back rolls.
00:10:44 [W] I can sit down a little so I think it will.
00:10:53 [W] Oh you start Gareth.
00:10:54 [W] Yeah, I think ultimately it's like there's not one right answer and unfortunately, I think it's always going to be about trade-offs and this sort of balance of how much you let kubernative bleed through into your
00:11:08 [W] Do developers need to know kubernative?
00:11:17 [W] I think he's a question that doesn't have a right answer.
00:11:18 [W] It's it is not it's not binary. It's not yes or no.
00:11:22 [W] And I think it's that question you need to ask which isn't just a security question that me like if the answer is yes in your context then I think reusing communities Primitives including our back makes a lot of sense that
00:11:37 [W] Simplicity from the fact that you're using the same things everywhere, I think in particular in small teams where ultimately you'd sort of doing everything that has benefits large organizations where that might be different group. You're trying to provide more of a puzzle like experience, I think.
00:11:53 [W] Leading through something quite as rich as committee's role based Access Control can sort of have like the opposite affect. The security comes in through people not fundamentally understanding our back because
00:12:09 [W] I think there is a definite answer. It does depend by think that think about generally whether you want to expose committees to developers or not.
00:12:19 [W] It's for I think that that's an interesting perspective and you are right it you want to have some flexibility depending on the end users you're working with right? So on the other hand to really effectively.
00:12:38 [W] As we see things added to the kubernetes platform things like servicemeshcon.
00:13:08 [W] Yes to the namespaces that they're working with and they're going to need to understand.
00:13:17 [W] You know, what they're allowed to do and what not allowed to do. So, I think it is a mix but at minimum that I think as we get more and more into Cloud native Solutions and add more capabilities for those developers on top of qu bit
00:13:29 [W] They are going to need to grow in their understanding of the basics of coup.
00:13:36 [W] And are back.
00:13:41 [W] Roger here's a question that that I think you know is relevant to all the panelists and I'll start with Scott the question comes from Jay Klein.
00:13:54 [W] Unfortunately, I don't know if I can make it public but maybe it's public already. But in any case, you know, it's a simple question but you know fairly lengthy answer I would expect what's holding back kubenetes from being secured by default. Let's start with car.
00:14:07 [W] This is a really interesting one.
00:14:10 [W] I was just reading this actually and I'll give you up for some reason on you throw this to me.
00:14:14 [W] I don't know why this isn't even a participant.
00:14:18 [W] Yeah, this is a really interesting question. And the reason why I think Upstream kubernative had so many security freak configurations that are not turned on by default is because it's meant to be implemented by different folks and what
00:14:32 [W] By that is open shoes implementation compared to Azure has implementation prepared to decays implementation is different.
00:14:44 [W] Once you start using like a provider that's burning kubernative for you.
00:14:48 [W] You will find that there will be secured The Faults on for you.
00:14:55 [W] know we do it some stuff in Azure, but there's also there's a line in the sand where it's like operability versus security and there's only so much a provider can do and make it easy for the developer as well.
00:15:03 [W] beyond that it needs to go to like the security professional of that organization because it could be a Nuance that 90 percent of the customers running on a Case don't need but 10 percent of the customers do need so that's why and I think
00:15:17 [W] Where it's like operability festive security and there's only so much a provider can do and make it easy for the developer as well anything beyond that it needs to go to like the security professional of that organization because it could be a
00:15:19 [W] so as we just spoke about servicemeshcon other capabilities on top of it secure by default looks a lot different for different folks like yeah, like if you take for example is CEO and
00:15:33 [W] Well, we're going to do one policy for identity and that'll work for every customer. It just it just won't work.
00:15:42 [W] So that's why I think there's nothing really holding us back as per se there's always work we can do but it comes down to do implementation of kubernative and the customer needs that's that's what I think the major thing is.
00:15:55 [W] Okay, if we can quickly go around get it.
00:15:59 [W] Do you want to go next?
00:16:00 [W] Yeah, I think it died following on from Scots pine that
00:16:05 [W] When you say kubenetes, do you mean a distribution of which can come with more opinions on do you mean the underlying software which invariably is optimized for for distribution for people to build things on top of it?
00:16:20 [W] And I think that's the tension ultimate as well changing things in hindsight is really hard. So I think now we're sort of five plus years on some of the original design decisions could be like
00:16:35 [W] Would do that different in hindsight but making that change now would fundamentally change and like in-toto make kubeedge. He's not difficult to adopt for everyone who comes next at this point.
00:16:50 [W] I think the addition of our back was a good example where the community said, actually we need to do this.
00:16:56 [W] Five plus years old some of the original design decisions could be like we would do that different in hindsight.
00:17:04 [W] But making that change now would fundamentally change and like in-toto make kubeedge.
00:17:04 [W] He's more difficult to adopt for everyone who comes next at this point.
00:17:05 [W] I think the addition of our back was a good example where the community said actually we need to do this. We need to break things in order to make it into injuries that get bility. So there is
00:17:07 [W] Preston for communities being fundamentally breaking backwards compatibility for security reasons.
00:17:11 [W] I'd like to see higher level Primitives.
00:17:24 [W] I think introducing kubernative that have better secure defaults than the lower level ones that are their pods the deployments even and but also I think there's there's been a conversation there of like, let's see those things emerge in the Community
00:17:26 [W] Like to see higher level Primitives, I think introducing kubernative that have better secure defaults than the lower level ones that are their pods the deployments even and but also I think there's there's been a conversation there of
00:17:28 [W] They haven't done yet.
00:17:31 [W] And so I think that's where we start start up and start outside kubernative.
00:17:37 [W] You have some higher-level primitive that sits above deployment adopt widely adopted wind better secure defaults if that's widely adopted then let's get into communities rather than thinking.
00:17:49 [W] That's the solution. That's at least what I would like to see
00:17:51 [W] perfect scarred Phil. Do you want to add any I mean, sorry Justin or Phil? Do you want to add anything?
00:18:01 [W] Sure.
00:18:03 [W] Yeah, I mean just won a couple sorry.
00:18:09 [W] Yeah, I think what one quick thing that kind of ties in with the idea of you know, distributions or use cases.
00:18:20 [W] I think the narrower your use case the more you can implement.
00:18:23 [W] Sort of a secure by default system, for example, if I build a functions as a service offering with kubernetes is the substrate.
00:18:34 [W] I have a much more limited set of container images that run because maybe I've enforced a certain policy around that so I think because and I think Gareth referred to this, you know kubernative is this concept
00:18:46 [W] Thing to build other things with I think there is this tension between adding all and turning on all these features in the base platform versus what do I build with it?
00:19:00 [W] And therefore what can I enforce given my potentially nearer use case that the entire kubernative ecosystem?
00:19:06 [W] Okay against in lost weight sure great.
00:19:17 [W] Thanks.
00:19:17 [W] So I think everybody's done a great job covering the distribution angle, which I think is absolutely right.
00:19:25 [W] This is very similar to what happened with Linux as Linux has a lot of complexity as well and you look to the distributions to provide security out-of-the-box and automated ways to configure for security. In addition. I think you know when we think about
00:19:40 [W] beginnings of there was originally I believe kind of the concept of multi-tenancy for a kubernative cluster was not a big an initial major consideration in the community and I think that affected a lot of the initial choices
00:19:54 [W] That a single tenant cluster you can you can have there's less need for things like are back potentially etcetera.
00:20:09 [W] So I do think it's really going to be interesting to see where the community goes because I've also seen an uptick in interest in securing kubernative sin. The community recently Red Hat has had security context constraints as
00:20:20 [W] Roller from early on to help ensure that malicious containers couldn't be deployed easily onto the container or privilege escalation was prevented that became pods security policies Upstream, but even though you know,
00:20:35 [W] Nation was prevented that became pods security policies Upstream.
00:20:37 [W] But even though you know, she is could bench marks recommend pods security policies the community still not convinced about that.
00:20:46 [W] So and I'm starting to see a drift towards Opa and Gatekeepers. So to gareth's point about kind of security that is maybe at a higher level or kind of at the perimeter of the coop cluster.
00:20:57 [W] Oh to to gareth's point about kind of security that is maybe at a higher level or kind of at the perimeter of the coop cluster.
00:21:01 [W] I think that maybe where we start to see the community be interested in investing.
00:21:04 [W] Yeah, great. Thanks.
00:21:09 [W] So one node. Two panelists.
00:21:12 [W] You guys are all very congenial nice to each other.
00:21:13 [W] Can we see some disagreement a little bit.
00:21:17 [W] I'm just kidding. But many case.
00:21:23 [W] Let's go to the next question, which is how far are we away from the true zero touch kubenetes development pipeline ecosystem. You know, how far are we really going as far as not having any human
00:21:33 [W] Anymore just purely token with token-based access and who wants to start here.
00:21:42 [W] Like I can't anybody.
00:21:47 [W] Okay Garrett.
00:21:51 [W] I think it depends on who you are.
00:21:55 [W] I think some people will be saying Linda we do this already and other people will be saying like, whoa, where the we're never going to get there. I think that it's a classic the future is here.
00:22:03 [W] just not evenly distributed.
00:22:06 [W] It's I'll rather than think is it possible.
00:22:12 [W] Can you build this can people can people do this?
00:22:13 [W] Because I think the answer is yes.
00:22:15 [W] There are people doing this easy easy to do do you need to do a lot of configuration yourself and a lot of composition yourself of a lot of tools.
00:22:25 [W] Yes, absolutely.
00:22:27 [W] I think that's sort of mythical distribution of everything and I'm not sure that we'll ever quite exist out of the box like at least in a sort of timeframe that the
00:22:43 [W] Go around the kubenetes community.
00:22:47 [W] think about because I think we build components and we integrate components and at some point.
00:22:55 [W] Yeah, they'll get industrialized but the component Builder will probably move on I didn't give you a just one thing the the finished article and it's nearly a generational technology thing.
00:23:06 [W] Y'all a integrator if you like building things together, this is possible to do today, but it's definitely not the norm.
00:23:15 [W] And if anyone else has a different opinion.
00:23:18 [W] no, I was actually going to say really well said
00:23:23 [W] perfect.
00:23:28 [W] I think the kubernative songwriters help help to move us in that direction.
00:23:35 [W] Good question.
00:23:40 [W] Oh, I was just going to say I think that the concept of kubernative operators help to move us in the direction where you can start towards less and less human interaction, but I do think that that it does kind of require a lot of building.
00:23:58 [W] Investment, but sort of the combination of operators with the gitops or go CD model. I think create a lot of possibility.
00:24:07 [W] Yeah, I think the fundamental thing there is control loops and Kazakh.
00:24:14 [W] Can you can you manage all operational sort of instructions via some form of control loops.
00:24:29 [W] However, you implement that and again, I think the answer is yes, but you will have to build a lot yourself and the and that might be a great cost in you're willing to pay today.
00:24:34 [W] Suggestion a vehicle has a question and you know, it seems simple again just like the over ASP top 10.
00:24:47 [W] Is there a top ten critical security risks for cloud native apps? Let's start with Scott again.
00:24:56 [W] I'm not sure on this one is a cloud that even I have seen some people do some stuff around owasp and like the communities API and a few other bits and pieces like that.
00:25:14 [W] I'm not sure if there's like an official one. You can go to every day that's updated. Like the the proper Heroes does anyone else know if there's
00:25:22 [W] the answer is actually it is the owasp top 10 the fact that you're running your applications on communities versus some other platform know versus like with some of the new technology doesn't change the fundamentals of
00:25:43 [W] Security and the the risks outlined in the our top ten. I still the things like that are going to get you some of them you can actually really apply very specifically to kubernative configuration
00:25:59 [W] Can actually really apply very specifically to kubernative.
00:26:00 [W] He's configuration risk is one of the sort of it.
00:26:02 [W] It issues there.
00:26:03 [W] It's always been a problem.
00:26:03 [W] It's in there as a sort of popular risk popular may be the wrong word.
00:26:15 [W] But that is that's a generic problem whether you're on kubelet ER not applied to kubernative. He's it's obviously you're going to have a lot of configuration at the moment around the communities consider. That's definitely something you should apply to.
00:26:24 [W] But I think fundamentally application security hasn't changed with Humanities. The Olof top 10 is still a good list of things to buy.
00:26:32 [W] Great, I'll come back to you because there was another question on kind of Shifting security left. But but let me get to this next question, which is about what do you think is the correct layer to enforce security Concepts like image signing.
00:26:49 [W] Is it the container runtime is that the merger registry or some operator within kubenetes and I let Phil drive this Phil if you want to jump in.
00:26:59 [W] Yeah, so that's an interesting question to me just because again, I've been mostly focused on the runtime layer and images and oci distribution.
00:27:15 [W] And there's there's a lot of folks involved here. Most of the cloud providers. Most of their registry teams are involved in effort called notary V2. I think there was even a talked about it earlier today or even a working group
00:27:27 [W] Smart people looking at this definitely up till now.
00:27:35 [W] It's been container runtimes and their implementation of their registry interactions that are handling the image signing capabilities. Whether it's Docker was notary or whether it's the red hat tools with
00:27:47 [W] Image signing capabilities whether it's Docker was notary or whether it's the red hat tools with gpg simple signing.
00:27:53 [W] You know, this is where most of the action is Ben. I think it is interesting because I work for a cloud provider to try and figure out you know, where the hook should be because now in my kubernative Slayer I want to know.
00:28:03 [W] Should be because now in my kubernative is layer. I want to know that somewhere in my stack the image signature was checked by the right, you know piece of the stack and then I can actually trust and verify that happened because
00:28:15 [W] Of like what Garrett said as soon as there's you know, potential configuration drift and somehow it got turned off or the policy got you know change that that I'm no longer checking image signatures.
00:28:31 [W] There are a lot of potential gaps and holes there to make sure that my kubernative stackrox.
00:28:45 [W] Know who signed them. So anyway, lots of good work happening in this area, but it's definitely something that cloud providers and security folks are very interested in.
00:28:56 [W] Perfect. Anybody has any other opinion sir?
00:29:03 [W] Okay, the next question comes from Casper Nissen.
00:29:13 [W] Thanks for asking the question and I myself am a developer. So the question is Shifting security left.
00:29:20 [W] How do you make developers care about security?
00:29:28 [W] Because you know as a developer, I really don't want to you know do too much but just make it work right now. So so what are you Parks?
00:29:36 [W] Let's start with Kirsten.
00:29:36 [W] Purrs care about security.
00:29:49 [W] Here's how I think about it. The real value of Shifting security left is removing. Your security team for developers is removing your security team as a blocker. No developer wants to be told just
00:30:03 [W] Left is removing. Your security team for developers is removing your security team as a blocker.
00:30:05 [W] No developer wants to be told just as they're ready to deploy their app to production that the security team has said.
00:30:09 [W] Nope.
00:30:09 [W] Sorry, you know, there's this late-breaking problem that we just learned about and you have to go back and start over.
00:30:20 [W] So I think the real value is making it easy for the Developers.
00:30:22 [W] To check and build Security in themselves and get sign off from the security team during those early stages so so that and and they're going to get value by knowing they're not going to get blocked at the end.
00:30:37 [W] Got it.
00:30:42 [W] I'm sure you have an opinion on this I do and I'm actually going to cheat a little bit here because I know Casper a little bit Casper is a software engineer.
00:30:53 [W] He's on his come along to a panel about security for you. That's that question and I would posit that actually developers like they want to know about security. They do think security is important, I think.
00:31:05 [W] It the actually developers like they want to know about security. They do think security is important. I think organizationally lots of organizations have told them it's not their problem.
00:31:11 [W] And that's the all they put up barriers that Mick security not about technology.
00:31:23 [W] And I think that's that there is there is an aspect of security.
00:31:24 [W] That's a lot more about information security.
00:31:26 [W] There's a rip there's a risk management aspect as a compliance aspect.
00:31:29 [W] That's not the same thing as security and organizations in lots of cases of sort of put those two together put them to a department that deals with risk and compliance and then said oh we've got Security Department.
00:31:42 [W] Oh, don't worry.
00:31:43 [W] Don't worry developers. You don't need to worry about security anymore.
00:31:47 [W] I think it's organizational that is organizations and organizational structures that have been the problem and I think if you say hey like Securities interesting and that's how I got into secure.
00:31:59 [W] From a from being a developer.
00:32:03 [W] I was I got to do some security with me.
00:32:04 [W] It was interesting.
00:32:07 [W] I think it's a developers are interested like insecurities organization lock them from learning more doing more and conflate security with up with risk and compliance.
00:32:19 [W] Change your organization to like allow developers to become interested like to allow developers to embrace their interest in security.
00:32:28 [W] Perfect.
00:32:33 [W] Next question.
00:32:38 [W] I know that card is really interested in part security. And this is a question from BET parasu.
00:32:39 [W] Hopefully I'm saying it right some Enterprise users want to see enhancements to Upstream part level security.
00:32:49 [W] is that on the roadmap are in scope for Cuba New tease?
00:32:50 [W] Well, yes.
00:32:54 [W] This is a really interesting one. And this is this is something that I'm really interested in.
00:32:59 [W] You notice upon security policy is kind of been in limbo for quite a while and
00:33:03 [W] This is kind of goes back to what Gareth was saying about before does put security policy need to be in kubernative or does it need to be abstracted outside of the distribution and then handled by something like open policy
00:33:15 [W] Betty Parris, ooh. Hopefully, I'm saying it right some Enterprise users want to see enhancements to Upstream part level security.
00:33:17 [W] Is that on the road map or in scope for Cuban eighties?
00:33:17 [W] Well, yes.
00:33:18 [W] This is a really interesting one. And this is this is something that I'm really interested in you'll notice that pain security policy is kind of been in limbo for quite a while and this kind of goes back to what Gareth was saying about before does
00:33:19 [W] Um, so at the moment there is more than just Opa as well.
00:33:21 [W] There's others other project out there open source project. So that are trying to achieve the same thing.
00:33:29 [W] So what we're seeing what we're starting to see is like increased increased capabilities there and then having a plug into like the distribution of kubernative because one of these days we'll have is if we keep
00:33:40 [W] Your and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger with all these things.
00:33:44 [W] It won't like it comes with consequences as well.
00:33:58 [W] So this is one of the first projects that I've seen where they're looking at something that's in base keeping. It is at the moment and they're looking at objecting the out to a third-party application and seeing how the community takes it.
00:34:01 [W] I really think it's exciting and I'm just watching it and seeing where it lands.
00:34:06 [W] It's still early days at the moment and if anyone else has an opinion jumping
00:34:14 [W] I think it's worth noting that the this change this is triggered a change and not just this this is triggered to change in how the committee's project treats beta so particular qualities have been in beta for basically ever and has a change
00:34:27 [W] Last five or six releases and the new policy as of like the latest release kubernative. These clothes go is that things are debt think that they say I think you have to releases now and it's either
00:34:43 [W] Those features are deprecated or you have to release a new feature or you have to reach the condition conditions to go to stable.
00:34:58 [W] So there's some pressure being added into the system, which I think is good to stop these features kicking just been left around.
00:35:05 [W] I think that in hindsight skews pot that pot secured policies addresses specific needs, but the the actual need is bigger. So they see people found that it's useful but not sufficient therefore having
00:35:13 [W] Stop these features kicking. It has been left around.
00:35:15 [W] I think that in hindsight skews pot that pot security policies addresses specific needs but the the actual need is bigger. So they see people found that it's useful but not sufficient therefore having
00:35:15 [W] I was like Signs actually duplicated that functionality.
00:35:17 [W] you need to that as well.
00:35:21 [W] So you might as well just have that and that that I think is allowing Innovation to happen outside again, I'm evolving open Paws agent project such as others as well.
00:35:30 [W] well. I think Kim cover no is one of the top my head there's number of other tools like with different approaches different user interfaces. And I think that that wouldn't happen if we just had said God's go-to policies is the is the answer.
00:35:44 [W] Yeah, I agree and I'd like the idea of abstracting it.
00:35:49 [W] And security, I mean pots security policies are right at the edge of kubernative way in many ways and that they're an admission controller, right?
00:36:02 [W] So abstracting is a little more straightforward than some other things.
00:36:05 [W] Okay moving on next question. You know, I really making a big deal of this seems like that's the question are the tenor of the question here.
00:36:20 [W] Have you ever seen node modules going rogue and Cuban eighties.
00:36:25 [W] Do you know about any attacks targeting kubenetes clusters in general and how would we protect against those kinds of attacks?
00:36:33 [W] Obviously, you know, I mean, I think we have talked quite a bit about you know in generalities, but but
00:36:35 [W] I mean IV really making a bigger deal than it should be I guess is the tenor of the question here.
00:36:42 [W] Phil you there or you want to start or
00:36:50 [W] okay. So question do you want to go?
00:37:00 [W] Um, so that's that's an interesting one.
00:37:16 [W] I mean, I think that you know, I'm used to getting questions about pods going rogue nodes going rogue is is even more interesting right?
00:37:22 [W] So I think there are a couple of things to look at and maybe related to The Host Os or targets a particular right? So I
00:37:26 [W] Oh, alright, then. I'm going to hand off to someone else.
00:37:32 [W] Yeah. Okay.
00:37:33 [W] Yeah, I think I figured out how to get off mute.
00:37:40 [W] It was stuck for a second. But so what he's feeling? All right. Yeah.
00:37:48 [W] Yeah. Yeah, so so I don't understand the connection with node modules, but the rest of the question is interesting in that, you know, they're quite a few security and infosec people making a name for themselves I think giving talks.
00:37:58 [W] The last two hours there were a couple talks about very specific attacks and see bees so, you know, there are clearly attacks that Target kubernative specifically.
00:38:12 [W] Second but the so what he's kind of got, all right.
00:38:17 [W] Yeah.
00:38:17 [W] Yeah, so so I don't understand the connection with node modules, but the rest of the question is interesting in that, you know, they're quite a few security and infosec people making a name for themselves.
00:38:18 [W] I think giving talks even in the last two hours.
00:38:19 [W] There were a couple talks about very specific attacks and see bees so, you know, there are clearly
00:38:20 [W] attacks that Target kubernative specifically there's been some some great talks even across the last few coupons about ways to you know, Target an attack kubernative clusters and the obviously there's been a good
00:38:23 [W] Is to you know, Target an attack kubernative clusters and the obviously there's been a good response from the community security team in closing some of these holes, you know, the it's a huge wide
00:38:31 [W] You know the it's a huge wide open discussion about how can we protect against these kinds of attacks?
00:38:39 [W] That's the whole nature of the the vendor industry around kubernative use the security tooling the ways you can Harden clusters the way you can Harden the operating system.
00:38:49 [W] So I you know, I think there's way too much that we wouldn't even have time to go into but I would say there's a lot of great resources being produced even here during kuchen.
00:38:57 [W] About various attacks in the mitigations for them for clusters.
00:39:03 [W] Thank you. Feel that.
00:39:10 [W] Let me give you one moment Gareth.
00:39:17 [W] Um, basically what I want to do was kind of, you know, wrap it up in a little bit but get it definitely I'll give you a chance but you know ones get it finishes this answering this question.
00:39:25 [W] I'll I'll go around, you know, just if you want to all the panelists, you know, if you want to summarize and and maybe few last words.
00:39:33 [W] Appreciate if all of you want to join the app Dev channel on slack.
00:39:40 [W] slack. We will carry on the discussion there having said that got it please go.
00:39:43 [W] I was just going to say I think one of the most sort of common things you hear about skiing securing communities that moment is still basically just publicly accessible control planes.
00:39:59 [W] There are Advanced attackers, but please secure you can secure your like Kuma. He's a pi server on the internet. That's still the thing that's going to unfortunately end up with you often
00:40:17 [W] Running a load of crypto Miners and most people aren't buying some people are working Industries and organizations where people really care about you often.
00:40:29 [W] It's just they want to spend your money on compute so they can walk away with money.
00:40:32 [W] So, please secure your API servers and then think about securing your applications and like then think about more advanced attackers and attacks.
00:40:40 [W] Right.
00:40:51 [W] I know there's a huge list of questions and you know kubernative security is not easy to talk in about 40 minutes, but hopefully you'll join up slack discussion app Dev on slack, but I'll give you
00:41:00 [W] Really want to thank the panelists like, you know, I know what Scott woke up at 1 o'clock, you know to kind of do this panel which is which is incorrect.
00:41:12 [W] You know, I don't think I would have done that but but really want to thank everybody the panelists all of you for the great questions.
00:41:19 [W] And what I'll do is I'll give like in the last two minutes, you know, if we can go around, you know starting with
00:41:24 [W] Scott and then going down if you have anything, you know quick last few words.
00:41:31 [W] Put me on the spot.
00:41:37 [W] No, I don't really have anything but I'll try to think of something quickly.
00:41:39 [W] That's why I'm I think with kubernative security. The one thing when I speak to to customers or folks out there is think about your risk compared to like the controls.
00:41:51 [W] Are you trying to put in place and don't read a blog post and think that there's Duma Gloom for someone said everything's everything's unsecured then read another blog post and say everything is secure.
00:42:01 [W] Pure just have a look at your business needs have a look at your risk management and then have a look at what controls you can put around keeping.
00:42:12 [W] He's to make it flexible for your application developers, but also have a good security posture.
00:42:17 [W] I think once you've tried to have a start looking in that in that sort of Realm you'll start to kick some goals.
00:42:20 [W] Thank you get it. You're next.
00:42:23 [W] Yeah, I'd say like I mean if you come along to this panel, if you're interested in Security in this area, like come get involved if you're an expert, that's fine. If you're not there are some series experts to learn from and I think learning Security in the context of this community is actually
00:42:39 [W] Probably more approachable than lots of other places you could do.
00:42:42 [W] So join in with like six security joining with the policy working group.
00:42:49 [W] There's the cncf sort of doing such as security bits pieces and the project sign open policy agent parsec now Falco, there's a lot of individual projects if you prefer to write some code and yeah just get involved.
00:43:02 [W] There's a lot to learn about a lot to contribute.
00:43:06 [W] perfect moving on Christian
00:43:10 [W] Yeah, great thoughts from everybody and I just want to Echo one thought that was mentioned briefly earlier.
00:43:24 [W] I think maybe by Gareth but but I think culture is an element that we really that it can be easy to neglect when we focus on the technology.
00:43:35 [W] So kubernative iners, they challenged some of the traditional approaches to security the same principles really apply.
00:43:40 [W] They apply in new ways, but I think the
00:43:42 [W] Troll shift is in many ways the most important one to try and tackle and and the more that you get involved the more that you learn the better able you maybe to help your organization kind of make that shift
00:43:57 [W] Left and collaborate and break down the silos for our new Cloud native world.
00:44:02 [W] in fact Phil lost times
00:44:06 [W] Yeah, great panel.
00:44:10 [W] Thanks for inviting me. I think I think even you know, as Gary said if you're interested, there's so much out there even just scrolling through the security identity policy
00:44:24 [W] Back from the last few days.
00:44:28 [W] I know I moderated a talk by Andrew Martin earlier today that had tons of detail just on container isolation.
00:44:38 [W] So, you know, depending on your area of Interest depending on what layer of the stack you're thinking about securing.
00:44:39 [W] there's a ton of great information and resources and places to get involved. So definitely encourage people to keep digging no matter what your level of expertise.
00:44:50 [W] Thank you. Again.
00:44:53 [W] Thanks everyone for attending.
00:44:55 [W] thank the panelists but I would be also to miss if I wouldn't tank the people behind the scenes.
00:45:03 [W] You know that it hold Ted Cruz helping here.
00:45:06 [W] I would love to tank, you know the cncf for doing such a great job.
00:45:12 [W] So, you know Scott was behind the scene Matt who's behind the scene.
00:45:14 [W] Thank you all very much that said we are just a little bit over, but but thanks again and and let's carry on the discussion at
00:45:21 [W] Devon the slack Channel.
00:45:23 [W] Bye.
