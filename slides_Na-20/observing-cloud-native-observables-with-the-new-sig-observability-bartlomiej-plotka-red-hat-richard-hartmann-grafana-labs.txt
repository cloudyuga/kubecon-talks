00:00:00 [W] Hi and welcome to observing Cloud native observables with the new Sig observability which already tells you that Observatory is kind of a buzzword, but there is some value to it.
00:00:09 [W] I'm Richard. I'm bartek.
00:00:13 [W] And observability at a very fundamental level is about making complex systems grovel for humans, and that's basically what we're working on.
00:00:20 [W] So if we look at our Charter, it's very much around fostering review and growing the ecosystem of and around of celebrity identifying and Reporting gaps within the cncf project portfolio find establish
00:00:35 [W] The best turned practices and the current is important because things change over time educate and inform its users about all of these without any bias, which obviously means no vendor lock-in truly vendor neutral venue for all thought
00:00:37 [W] No vendor lock-in truly vendor neutral venue for all thought validation and such and a little bit of a test balloon.
00:00:42 [W] We are doing more in you diligence reports and other six that we actually walk through the whole you diligence process to take some load off of Toc and one thing which you really really really try and do is have a
00:00:57 [W] do is have a bias for Action course, usually any any new Endeavor is always nice and cool and China and everyone's to join and we are trying very very hard to actually push for actual bias for
00:01:12 [W] Trying very very hard to actually push for a true bias for actual action and virtual outcomes looking at our past activities.
00:01:22 [W] We obviously chartered ourselves and serve created with the blessing of the TOC and we did already to incubation reviews and due diligence has reports for cortex and finops both of which pests and are now
00:01:38 [W] No in incubating stage, we started Gathering requirements about online learning online analytics platforms and analytics and we already explored some overlap with AI.
00:01:51 [W] + mL. Of course, especially in metrics land business like Perfect singing for for machines to understand and guac and also integrate with other projects for some knowledge and
00:02:06 [W] So might be already aware. Our absorbedly lenses cape in the cncf space is already quite quite reach in we have kind of different levels of project
00:02:21 [W] cncf and in graduated we have you know fluency, which is related to logging Jágr, which is a tracing system from the ears, which is a fair system that that kind of get into the cncf from the observability space around
00:02:32 [W] Maturing and then we have you know incubated stage where we have cortex and tunnels which are you know, metric kind of metric system scaling Prometheus and those are kind of bolted here because those are we're
00:02:45 [W] And well thanks to the SQL Server ability kind of movement and we are looking to help, you know other projects graduate as well and join our space we have opentracing which now kind of merge into the opentelemetry, but still is incubated Project around
00:02:58 [W] we have opentracing which now kind of merged into the opentelemetry but still is incubated Project around tracing and then in sandbox we have, you know cows Smash and litmuschaos for a related to cows engineering and
00:03:11 [W] For a related to cows engineering and yeah, please join our meetings to learn more about them.
00:03:19 [W] We will kind of shared knowledge as well.
00:03:20 [W] We have openmetrics, which is essentially metric format and kind of exposition well-established format and Proto go around around all all applications and opentelemetry at the end which
00:03:35 [W] amazing progress as you could see if you following the Twitter or actions and you know kind of collaborating with many many vendors and allowing them to kind of integrating well within single simple kind of application
00:03:50 [W] On your infrastructure is kind of amazing.
00:03:52 [W] So, you know that the observability kind of space here is is very rich already. You can you can do a lot just using those projects but you know, that's not everything right there.
00:04:05 [W] We are definitely not done yet with this landscape and there might be some awesome observability areas that you know are missing from this landscape, or maybe we can integrate better with right so
00:04:19 [W] So if you look at the implications or at the overlap there is obvious overlap between the three golden signals metrics logs and traces in exactly this order basically perrito
00:04:34 [W] If you look at the Integrations or at the overlap.
00:04:36 [W] There is obvious overlap between the three golden signals metrics logs and traces in exactly this order basically perrito principle that that's just the ordering of the most bang for your buck versus
00:04:54 [W] So ordering of the most bang for your buck versus versus the effort you need to put into the usually makes sense to start with Matrix, then go to logging then go to tracing that's just kind of the Natural Evolution and if I do say, so myself
00:05:10 [W] in helped really connect the dots of it there openmetrics took the label based metrics Exposition format of Prometheus already back in 2015 the the intention was to also
00:05:25 [W] And events with the same labor based access mechanisms, which was performed a locally we have which is super nice. And as was announced we are recording this on a Tuesday.
00:05:36 [W] So yesterday my time.
00:05:37 [W] I don't know by how doing when this is actually showing tracing a stomach Samplers what that means is basically you only have an ID for your traces.
00:05:49 [W] And nothing else.
00:05:51 [W] So you come into your traces from metrics and logs which are relevant to your course.
00:05:56 [W] They have like high latency or there was an error or what have you and those obviously carry label sets with Rich data, which enables you to actually go to what is interesting to you and then you just jump into the trace with the help of an idea and you don't need to have
00:06:11 [W] Into your traces from metrics and logs which are relevant to your course.
00:06:13 [W] They have like high latency or there was an error or what have you and those obviously carry label sets with Rich data, which enables you to actually go to what is interesting to you and then you just jump into the trace with the help of an idea and you don't need to
00:06:43 [W] needle in a haystack problem of of tracing and personally, I think that exemplars are the future for traces like absolutely 100% and this is why even back in 2016 openmetrics already had support for traces, which
00:06:58 [W] Through the primate Prometheus cortex tennis and also Loki ecosystem and with Griffon Temple.
00:07:05 [W] We now have something which actually stores traces based on on exemplars. But there's more we have continuous profiling where you have an obvious overlap between metrics and tracing which kind of goes in this direction, but
00:07:21 [W] Precisely should we have a new project which which can actually store those or can we make either of the other fields of or groups of solutions work for year?
00:07:28 [W] Then there's another thing which I think is too often overlooked crash dumps.
00:07:33 [W] You can argue that there is somewhere sitting in between tracing and logging but having informed State about hey something actually ordered abnormally and this is what what it's dying gasp was I think will be useful in the future.
00:07:48 [W] Future to actually figure out why something specifically hit the wall, but this is just us thinking about those things. There are certainly other signals and we would love to hear about your thoughts around what else might be
00:08:03 [W] Because that's that's literally what a Sig is about. It is a special interest group and we highly highly highly recommend and invite anyone to come to us actually talk about what you want to see in the space.
00:08:17 [W] Yes, and there are actually you know much more we are doing right now which is on our plate. So let's let's do quickly go through that.
00:08:25 [W] We started to know our proper meetings.
00:08:29 [W] Let's say a couple months ago really so so pretty pretty early.
00:08:34 [W] However, we already started to kind of few directions here and there and it's really about you know, building this community around
00:08:44 [W] Sir ability to make sure you know everyone can contribute in their area of expertise. So, you know by allocating those kind of small working groups and let's say some groups that are focusing on one area
00:08:59 [W] It's here and there and it's really about you know be building this community around Lobster ability to make sure you know, everyone can contribute in their of expertise so, you know
00:09:23 [W] And we can just scale and do much more better together.
00:09:26 [W] So examples of things we are doing right now. We are definitely looking forward to just start, you know seek observability strong and to learn more about projects and each other.
00:09:37 [W] That's why we are planning to have some introduction webinars.
00:09:40 [W] We already have some introduction thing.
00:09:43 [W] Thanks to Steve from about opentelemetry.
00:09:46 [W] We are planning to I think host litmuschaos project as a first first one which will introduce them.
00:09:53 [W] Ourselves so we can learn about you know, their problems problems each project problems.
00:09:59 [W] Maybe we can have, you know kind of collaboration there in terms of you know, Integrations and kind of user experience of really any concept of maintaining open source project even that is related to observability.
00:10:14 [W] Land here and other aspect is, you know, this locking of well integration between a good integration between let's say infra infrastructure engineers and big data
00:10:29 [W] And indict engineer's there is not much, you know conversion formats and API integration towards this connection. So as a first thing in we started to yeah look on how to get metrics from
00:10:36 [W] Openmetrics from from the projects we support like Prometheus tunnels cortex and get or like opentelemetry and get into pocket file.
00:10:41 [W] Apache are oh, you know many many projects from Apache foundation, for example how to integrate that.
00:10:46 [W] So yeah, we started some few see some cool coding but also some user requirements. So depending on your background you can help in many many areas next one, which is kind of starting right now, we recently
00:11:01 [W] Had this observability rather, which was amazing because we you know suddenly have more data to understand to what is the interest regarding the project and the problem space.
00:11:12 [W] However, obviously you cannot, you know easily ask people you might have, you know, some bias information based on your connections, and that's normal.
00:11:23 [W] So we are kind of starting some effort into making, you know, maybe improving this this kind of surveys and making them.
00:11:31 [W] You know easier are and actually make companies motivated to actually take part in those surveys to actually have meaningful data that everyone is is trusting right? So there is some work on that side and
00:11:47 [W] Last but not the least is Introduction to observability. Right? Like there are lots of questions that are people coming to our meeting and saying okay.
00:11:53 [W] I don't know where to start.
00:11:54 [W] I just, you know want to improve observability in my company.
00:11:58 [W] How do I start and there is no good like, you know starting.
00:12:03 [W] Starting docs or I don't know some index that will route you to the particular projects or materials that explain you, you know certain certain problems. Like for example, how I do I gather metrics?
00:12:16 [W] When do I switch to Locks? Do I need tracing?
00:12:19 [W] What is distributed tracing what is profiling and all of those survey maybe for some people it's obvious but sometimes some direction initial direction is very needed. So we are looking forward into into creating some ways of
00:12:33 [W] I'm having some may be a good intro duction page that will route to at least, you know cncf landscape projects.
00:12:41 [W] I think it's a good opportunity to also collaborate with other seeks to learn how they share knowledge in and have some method of doing that.
00:12:51 [W] So if you want to help in this direction, maybe help us writing some some better documentation, maybe, you know, actually write that the documentation on each of the projects and and kind of fruit and linkerd.
00:13:03 [W] Them together in one place that will be super amazing and we are looking for your ideas and feedback and last but not the least.
00:13:10 [W] To make sure they are well supported well-maintained. So we are looking into no of proposals of getting projects hire one particular ideas or like proposals. We will be working right now is openmetrics.
00:13:12 [W] I think I mean openmetrics moving quite fast and we are considering you know, yeah, maybe have some review in terms of incubation graduation. So all sorts of kind of actions like that is in our scope.
00:13:18 [W] Next I'm bartek.
00:13:20 [W] I'm kind of you know tekhelet here and we have reached here who is sick a chair. We have also not young who is another signature and this is kind of along starting point, but we have also I mean huge amount of amazing people who contributed
00:13:35 [W] Throwability they were on our meetings. They help us with the review and preparation of the charter dogs and they are part of you know, all those smaller working in groups and direction.
00:13:43 [W] We are we are creating. So yeah, I'm so many of those and and to and it's super nice that you know, we can kind of build the community with those amazing people and and anytime you need help.
00:13:54 [W] they are super happy to just you know, use their time in order to end reach this.
00:14:00 [W] Survivability no open source.
00:14:04 [W] It's super amazing them.
00:14:06 [W] Thank you everyone and yeah, you will meet all those people although all of them are friendly and amazing.
00:14:12 [W] So please join us just to meet people really that's that's one first argument you can have and yeah, so action action I can for you how you can help how you can join us if you want.
00:14:24 [W] Well, first of all, we have be weekly meetings.
00:14:28 [W] have a Google doc here will share slides. You can click on it and we
00:14:33 [W] Cassandra those meetings to be you know, mostly introduction Airy, maybe some presentations maybe some status update, but we've meant for those meetings well for the actual work to be to be done
00:14:48 [W] Things we are two large group already to actually, you know do everything in one hour.
00:14:48 [W] So please be prepared for that.
00:14:51 [W] But obviously, please put stuff on agenda and and add, you know any copy that you that you want there.
00:14:59 [W] We have our repository go there.
00:15:01 [W] There are like basic informations there put an issue on the repository. If you if you want to have some a synchronous method of doing some requests for us.
00:15:12 [W] We have cieslak we have mailing list and yeah, you can help with all of those staff.
00:15:17 [W] Maybe you have some feedback.
00:15:18 [W] Maybe you want to have maybe you need some help as a project of on observability Project or maybe Observer the project may be outside of it cncf. Even you don't want know how to start how to integrate.
00:15:29 [W] Maybe you have ideas.
00:15:31 [W] We want them.
00:15:32 [W] Maybe you have just free time and they don't know what to do that.
00:15:35 [W] will definitely have some ideas how to allocate this. So please do next.
00:15:41 [W] So that's it.
00:15:42 [W] Thank you for listening now is really the time for any live questions.
00:15:48 [W] You have to ask our talk was bit shorter just for this purpose if you want to take this opportunity and ask questions related to see cops durability and just learn more. We're happy to take questions.
00:16:01 [W] Looking forward to the question. Thank you very much.
00:16:04 [W] Hello.
00:16:00 [W] Hello.
00:16:07 [W] Okay, welcome everyone.
00:16:09 [W] We are here to answer some questions live.
00:16:14 [W] So why not taking the first one?
00:16:17 [W] What's the date relationship between cncf C cups?
00:16:38 [W] Can you hear me Richie?
00:17:01 [W] I am so I can I can explain as well.
00:17:05 [W] So that's a very good question because you know both both communities and and you know cncf special interest groups has something observability.
00:17:17 [W] um how they can improve observability site, although kind of instrumentation is is maybe
00:17:16 [W] You know kind of different word kind of meaning the same thing.
00:17:19 [W] We actually are collaborating with with them. Actually my colleague ex-colleague Frederick Branch expected of the instrumentation.
00:17:26 [W] I was kind of attending as well.
00:17:28 [W] So hopefully we can we can collaborate much more but what our scope is much more wider on the whole cncf multi-project ecosystem and maybe collaboration and signals between them and stackrox.
00:17:45 [W] Around that versus kubernative Observer see is relations is really focused and scope to kubernative project and very deeply creating tools and and and work on things around that so it can be more focused on
00:18:00 [W] And stuff around that versus Cuban. It is Observer see is station is is really focused and scope to kubernative project and very deeply creating tools and and and work on things around
00:18:28 [W] Cool. So rich, he able to answer any question or I mean or just me not hearing you.
00:18:37 [W] We don't know.
00:18:42 [W] So I can go on so any another question is okay.
00:18:52 [W] I have a I have a green light to to continue life question for you.
00:18:56 [W] Hopefully we are sinking with riches.
00:18:58 [W] So he's contributing to those answers as well any plans to build a tool ecosystem which will help jumping down to Containers or notes of Interest kind of bringing troubleshooting tools.
00:19:12 [W] Supporting observability product for Maria's.
00:19:15 [W] I think this is this is great question and you know in observability special interest group we plan to, you know, not create software directly. Like we are not developers that you know aim to just
00:19:30 [W] We want to kind of cover gather those requirements discuss about what is the priority of those what community needs and maybe you know smart brains that actually have ideas how to solve it how to collaborate between those projects
00:19:46 [W] Some software or some solution or maybe you know spec together.
00:19:43 [W] So this subject is totally totally makes sense and what we can do we can we can definitely bring this topic to our meeting. So please join please add a data item for that and and that's very relevant what
00:19:59 [W] King for is essentially, you know some some way of drilling down and I guess yeah drilling down from from maybe metrics or different signal tracing to logging into trouble shooting
00:20:12 [W] A huge work in progress in this in this form.
00:20:11 [W] We are talking here about correlations between observability signals.
00:20:16 [W] So for example, maybe going through the metric to you have some Metric because you got an alert you want to sculpt down to the same kind of application and log lines produced within this time. Then you may be going to want to go to
00:20:31 [W] From Matrix directly to tracing first of all thanks to of exemplars all those projects in the cncf ecosystem like opentelemetry like openmetrics like tunnels cortex.
00:20:42 [W] Prometheus are really kind of going into the direction. So please if you want to help and or you want to kind of learn more, please attend our obsessions and we can definitely discuss this more.
00:20:54 [W] Next question.
00:20:56 [W] Good talk.
00:20:57 [W] I have a question. I'm new to observability and I would like to know how to start contributing to an of your projects.
00:21:03 [W] That's that's amazing questions.
00:21:06 [W] Well, and we have those couple hookup of couple of times already and we are actually started working group where we are kind of discussing how to, you know, create some index some some kind of getting started.
00:21:21 [W] Getting started dogs and and papers on you know, maybe you know some kind of, you know Discovery page where you can learn about.
00:21:29 [W] What is the purpose of each project?
00:21:31 [W] And how do you can easily collaborate and and and join in wherever whatever your use cases that you need to solve our and I think that's a that's something some some missing bit. So we are working on it, please join our sessions
00:21:46 [W] Is of each project and how do you can easily collaborate and and and join in wherever whatever your use case is that you need to solve our and I think that's a that's something some some missing bit. So we are working on it, please
00:22:19 [W] Cole said yeah become part of this become part of this workgroup and and work with us to kind of kind of make that happen and and learn on the way so that's definitely good topic.
00:22:32 [W] We need to solve in the community.
00:22:35 [W] Yeah, let's go for the next one.
00:22:40 [W] Cuban it is implementation like cubelets API servers.
00:22:44 [W] Will it going to have traces support?
00:22:47 [W] Well that particular question actually should go to kubenetes sic instrumentation more I would say they have much more knowledge and kind of awareness of what is planned and what what's ahead
00:23:02 [W] I think it's actually good to way to sync with them from time to time.
00:23:07 [W] They will be super nice.
00:23:08 [W] And as far as I know, they definitely have that on the road map.
00:23:15 [W] But anyway, you can definitely put that on our cncf observability agenda so we can sync up and maybe help them as well and and learn about this because that's that's definitely something nice to bring tracing into kubernative because it's a complex
00:23:30 [W] Next one Kudo on treat seek observability as a space for finding companies individuals interested in collaborating on a new cncf project.
00:23:36 [W] can the seek help in gaining recognition and contributors while I think this is like very cool idea that we never widely spoke about and and it's actually pretty
00:23:52 [W] I can totally do that.
00:23:48 [W] In fact, we are responsible in kind of investigating detecting a gaps in the you know, ecosystem space.
00:23:57 [W] Maybe there are some, you know missing features in our Spectrum.
00:24:02 [W] For example, there is no logging project right now in the cncf space something that is missing that that's worth bringing into the cncf and maybe if nothing else actually exist that that works well in the open source and and
00:24:16 [W] And one who want to be part of the cncf that there's totally opportunity to start some projects apps one example of such project was Ops latex.
00:24:26 [W] This is like a project which transforms metrics data into some analytics format like Park and file or Apache arrow and we started that thanks to the sink observe with you as well because we discuss this topic discussed those topics and
00:24:41 [W] Knowledge are actually gather more awareness and and more contributors towards that so definitely put that on the agenda. If you have some ideas about missing features projects that you want to collaborate with maybe help with and gather a team of
00:24:52 [W] Sync features projects that you want to collaborate with maybe help with and gather a team of motivated people passionately people to actually do this work.
00:24:55 [W] Amazing the next amazing questions, by the way, any comment query plan to do across metrics logs and traces on a given context. I think kind of it was mentioned before that
00:25:11 [W] I think kind of it was mentioned before that. We can definitely kind of discuss this think about what the are the use cases that
00:25:33 [W] right, sorry collaboration correlation signal correlation design docs and that will allow better querying based on that.
00:25:41 [W] I guess. This is the question.
00:25:42 [W] Hopefully, I answered next one.
00:25:46 [W] I think we have two more minutes if I'm not wrong is tracing more for tracing the network calls between microservices or is it also for tracing the individual work done within one?
00:25:59 [W] For service, I think this is a great great question and overall both.
00:26:06 [W] It's actually very useful for both kind of spectrum of this of this kind of tracing his ability.
00:26:16 [W] You can definitely have complex path of in know multiple function calls that are so complex that it needs to be traced. You can create spans and in-toto.
00:26:29 [W] Instrument that within your micro service but also well in the same way if you think about microservices what it is and how it communicates with other microservices doors are just function calls as well.
00:26:44 [W] Um kind of tracing his ability. You can definitely have complex path of in know multiple function calls that are so complex that it needs to be traced.
00:26:58 [W] You can create spans and instrument that within your micro service, but also well in the same way if you think about microservice what it is and how it communicates with other microservices doors are just
00:27:30 [W] Sinkholes are PCS and maybe it's using you know, rest, you know HTP maybe grpc, but at the end doors are kind of remote procedures, so there is not much different like from the perspective of tracing there is different.
00:27:45 [W] The street racing but how you see that on the UI of the trace like in the Jaeger Zipkin or anything like that? It shows you the function calls over the network. Some of them are in internal. So definitely you can do both.
00:28:01 [W] Next one any plans to make this observability contents free contents to more AI analytic friendly.
00:28:09 [W] Yes, that's definitely a plan and there is definitely missing Gap here.
00:28:13 [W] That's why we created obviously takes maybe to gather some analytic kind of no data from Matrix into some analytic formats, but we want to hear your use case as well and we got
00:28:28 [W] We are out of time.
00:28:28 [W] so please follow up with questions on our slack Channel.
00:28:31 [W] Thank you.
00:28:34 [W] See ya.
