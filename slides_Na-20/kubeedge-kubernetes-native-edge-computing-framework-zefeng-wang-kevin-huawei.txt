00:00:00 [W] Welcome to the kubeedge introduction session.
00:00:02 [W] I'm Kevin won the maintainer of kubeedge project today.
00:00:06 [W] in consideration of texture and also Community updates including new 6 and new features and there I will quickly go through the use case and the future plan and hopefully we can have time for the QA so we know that the
00:00:22 [W] Networks is becoming more and more powerful today and more and more people start to build business at the on the edge.
00:00:31 [W] So we know that the moving from Central Cloud to age is very helpful to improve the entrant business trip and latency and also reduce the bandwidth consumption between
00:00:47 [W] And age and also very helpful to through the security and the Privacy while the workloads betraying cloud and age are very different.
00:00:54 [W] So in the central Cloud that's we are that are actually we are very friendly. So as AI for example more and more than half workloads in the central cloud or a training and also there are a few
00:01:09 [W] While in The In Crowd, it becomes the different because the dehydrates the computing power is less than the central cloud and it's much more closer to the end user.
00:01:22 [W] So typically consists more of translating workloads and including a few inferencing Wild on the iot age. It's actually very very close to the data source and the end user so
00:01:37 [W] Almost running the inferencing workloads there.
00:01:38 [W] So basically from the cloud to the H the closer to the age the lower latency and while the underlying Hardware are very different.
00:01:49 [W] So in the central Cloud, we know that we have a very standard physical servers, but the underage they are very different like cancerverse and iot gateways.
00:02:00 [W] So the hardware and the heart rate types are very different.
00:02:06 [W] So why trying to build each Computing platform with kubernative we know that the kinetics and the climate of Technology are very successful in the ecosystem, especially in defined the
00:02:21 [W] application model which make it really easy to build it once on everywhere and also the layering our containerd image mechanism makes it very easy to optimize the the whole image size and also communities
00:02:33 [W] The good application obstruction and already becomes the de facto standard in the central Cloud. If we build with the same technology, it's very easy to achieve same experience across cloud and the age and also for kubenetes itself
00:02:39 [W] Is very accessible including the EPA Machinery the ci/cd mechanism and also for communities they deserve it's very easy to add a customized components.
00:02:48 [W] Customized controllers and or operators, but there are also some challenges so we know that the age one of the difference to the central cloudbees that the resources are quite limited, especially in the iot and the industry case.
00:03:03 [W] the consumers can be done to for example, 512 megabytes and maybe even less but for a vanilla from the net is almost at the smaller deployment need one D of X, right and
00:03:17 [W] For a vanilla vanilla is almost at the smaller Department with one gigabyte and even just the kubelet.
00:03:19 [W] It takes a lot of memory and also the network between cloud and H are quite different some of the age locates behind a firewall or inside a private network doesn't have a public IP.
00:03:30 [W] public IP. And also the are better with are very limited and also the latency is very different compared to the networking side a Data Center and if we
00:03:42 [W] Want to run the applications on the edge really really in a good experience. We need to resolve the autonomy of the age because the age may be different may be disconnected and offline often or
00:03:57 [W] The latency is very different compared to the networking side a Data Center. And if we want to run the applications on the edge, really really in a good experience. We need to resolve
00:04:53 [W] Time in that case. We should not affect or McGrady applications because the we just lost the connection not mostly the physical servers and the expenses there and the another big challenge is that in the
00:05:08 [W] Cases, there are a lot of each device use different device protocols. So how to simplify that for the application developer is also a very big challenge.
00:05:22 [W] So kubeedge try to build on top of communities and extend the the powerful functionality from cloud Central Cloud to achieve seem experience and build the a standard application management.
00:05:40 [W] Magnesium across clown and age especially kubeedge provides a seamless cloud and age coordination by implementing a bi-directional communication Channel and make it able to to
00:05:57 [W] Magnesium across cloudy and age especially kubeedge provides a seamless cloud and age coordination by implementing a bi-directional communication Channel and make it able to to communicate.
00:06:29 [W] Even going through a private subnet. So I want to also highlight that kubeedge you start with the putting the node Community snowed in I'm to the age because that's much easier for Lotus low
00:06:44 [W] and also kubeedge introduce that node level meter data persistency, which reduce the disaster recovery time to make the note get ready even more faster and also we did some
00:06:59 [W] To make the anode get ready even more faster. And also we did some optimization to reduce the memory framework footprint on the on the edge components. So itself takes around
00:07:12 [W] Clint's so itself takes around 70 megabytes. And also we support the oci compliment around times.
00:07:21 [W] For example, we integrate with cryo at the total memory consumption can be less than 100 megabytes. And also another thing is that for iot and the industrial internet kubeedge provided a extensible framework to simplify
00:07:37 [W] Divide its special specialized device protocol into the platform.
00:07:42 [W] So the application developers can focus more on developing their own applications.
00:07:48 [W] So this is a very high level view of the kubeedge architecture. So on the top, let me start
00:07:58 [W] On the top you can find out actually it's a vanilla still vanilla and kubenetes cluster and kubeedge just added a few Originals, so to the communities and master because we understand the mechanism of communities work, so it's actually
00:08:14 [W] Uh, no same as the cloudevents but actually the categories dealing with the shadow management of the real world which notes on the age.
00:08:23 [W] So the in the bi-directional communication our Channel we use web socket by default and we also developed developed the quick support as a alternative. We some different cases
00:08:38 [W] As I mentioned that we are supported the ability or the associate informant contain the runtime and also with support the state and I and the the CSI storage on the age and the for the part mark
00:08:46 [W] Standard Network environment might be different in the data center or in the cloud.
00:08:45 [W] So we introduced the mesh layer to resolve the only communication things and for the devices so so uh today is actually relying on mqtt because mqtt
00:09:00 [W] And for the devices so so uh today is actually relying on mqtt because the activity is been more popular than the other industrial protocols.
00:09:13 [W] So basically for the device developers, they can develop a protocol and converter to integrate with the device using the it's actual device protocol while converting the
00:09:28 [W] The audio message content that to mqtt. So for the application developers, they are much much more easier to develop their own applications.
00:09:37 [W] They just need to deal with your communication through mqtt instead of the the other actual us protocol.
00:09:46 [W] for the clock or here, I just want to highlight that it's actually dealing with the eyeshadow management for the notes on the age and also to devices
00:09:58 [W] So 42 D communities cluster or the the node object and also the application object lifecycles lifecycle actions are are reflecting.
00:10:09 [W] So the to deterministic master just the trick all the things that in the same.
00:10:15 [W] So inside the cloud cover we have each controller. So this one is Shadow management for actually the core apis including the the nodes Parts config map Etc and also for the iot
00:10:31 [W] So he said cloud cover we have each controller. So this one is should have management for actually the core apis including the the nodes Parts config map Etc and also for the iot.
00:10:51 [W] And Industry device management on the age. We introduced a set of device API including the device model and device instance. And we also added a device controller to reflect the life cycle updates and it's basically the shuttle management for the devices on the edge.
00:11:06 [W] The thing you said we added a single controller to do a Recon settlement between the cloud and the Aging cases that any consistent consistency detecting the kubeedge.
00:11:20 [W] Zsi driver is actually a plug into trying to hook the requested like storageos provisioning requested to the age. So with kubeedge CSL driver, it's very easy to integrate third party.
00:11:35 [W] To the edge so we have kubeedge CSR a driver. It's very easy to integrate third-party CSI drivers on the edge.
00:11:46 [W] So basically you can export any existing third-party CSI driver implementation to kubeedge. You don't need to worry about the the communication between cloud and age you can just the storm of the whole back end to the edge
00:12:01 [W] With you since I drove over to deal with here everything and the admission web hook currently is validating the extended API like the device API, and also we are developing a lot of
00:12:16 [W] Show up group currently evaluating the extended API like the device API. And also we are developing a lot of
00:12:24 [W] Best of Rarities enforcement for for the edge Computing use cases for example with no doubt become offline for a period of time. We may not affect the part in the default period
00:12:44 [W] Enforcement for for the including use cases, for example, if no doubt become offline for a period of time. We may not affect the part in the default period of time.
00:13:00 [W] So how Kuma Q8 works so so this one we are you might be familiar.
00:13:06 [W] It's actually a life cycle of a of a application running in a vanilla communities cluster.
00:13:13 [W] So so actually what kubeedge D is a equivalent replacement of a vanilla coolant Behavior.
00:13:24 [W] So in the vanilla communities, we know that after a scheduled find a
00:13:30 [W] Probably notify part it will update the pain staff to fill up the pot name and then the kubelet will gladly notification and then spin up the Pod the containers that note right so in kubeedge
00:13:45 [W] To spin up a container of the age of actually after scheduler Bond the party to a note the cloud cover will got the notification of the parts updated and it will filter out.
00:14:00 [W] hearts that are scheduled to the notes on the age and the send the information is to all the relevant notes on the one and then the corresponding each core on that note
00:14:01 [W] Message so the media manager will will reflect that the local mayadata persistency basically a persistent the point to the node and then tell HD to spin up the
00:14:15 [W] Are you study eight o'clock Each corner? So so H Hobbies actually a equivalent implementation comparing to the cloud heart.
00:14:22 [W] It's actually dealing with the communication between cloud and age and also make it possible to talk across firewall or or or even the ages behind a the agency located inside a private Network.
00:14:37 [W] We will do the basically provide the elotl level meter data persistence functionality. HD is a lightweight kubelet implementation.
00:14:43 [W] So we basically our vendor the vanilla giblet and skip the some of the packages that are not quite Irrelevant in the in Computing use cases.
00:14:53 [W] So the device screen is dealing actually for the iot an industry or Internet cases. It's sinking the device datastax.
00:15:03 [W] Between Cloud each node and device.
00:15:07 [W] So the H bars event policy say mqtt to to to talk between the wrestling and the dress mapper actually.
00:15:20 [W] And also the agh measure as mentioned in the previous slides is dealing with the part part and also the service load balancing and also note level or local DNS resolution reservation.
00:15:35 [W] So for the community release development, we actually released every three months the feature planning starts in the beginning of each release life cycle, and we typically freezer without when
00:15:50 [W] Only two weeks left to and final release date to focus on fixing bugs and stabilize the release another thing especially to highlight here is that we know that on the age the a lot of
00:16:05 [W] Based on the arm architecture, but so kubeedge Community we support x86 and arm like texture s knative tekton of through-hole release life cycle. So for code we know that we just around pulling the
00:16:08 [W] Building we have the first Duty and for testing we have an architectural special tests. And also we will see I we have a full-on Vista CA tests and also the x86.
00:16:20 [W] Vacations so for kubeedge Community, very big new exciting news to share here is then we moved to cncf equation in September this year. So currently we have
00:16:33 [W] Currently we have more than 3000 starts and 400 800 folks on GitHub and also more than 500 contributors joined the community and we also have a lot of
00:16:46 [W] Up and also more than 500 contributors joined the community and we also have a lot of decisions organizations joining the Community Development.
00:16:54 [W] And another thing I want to highlight here is that we are currently moving to the Sig based on this model.
00:17:02 [W] So we enforce the iot device security device.
00:17:07 [W] So this one is focusing on the iot and the industrial internet relevant work to improve
00:17:14 [W] kubeedge and also provide a better user experience developer experience for the iot enter you into in the industry internet.
00:17:22 [W] And another thing is the NEC.
00:17:25 [W] So this one is to basically leverage kubeedge the leveraging Mac platform development with kubeedge inside.
00:17:35 [W] And another thing the discussion is about is the pi Sig. This is trying to prevent better for mental functioning.
00:17:44 [W] Ready for the AI workloads coordinating between cloud and age like Federated learning and also the incremental trending incremental inferencing.
00:17:59 [W] So so here is a short list of the organization's inside contributing in the community so we can find that we have the iot and a hardware organizations including armed send them some and also we
00:18:15 [W] Of technicals and also the IT service providers and also the cloud providers and also some of the academics are also doing our research around kubeedge.
00:18:28 [W] So for the use cases, we currently have more than 20 adopters and here are some of the production of adoption including the China Highway.
00:18:40 [W] It is a system and also a risk on music the user to Beijing.
00:18:44 [W] Their Factory to improve the production line safety.
00:18:49 [W] And also she hired iot they built with kubeedge to the developed a smart campus solution with kubeedge.
00:19:04 [W] The me see, let me see special interest group.
00:18:51 [W] So this one is actually focusing on the reference architecture leveraging the MVC with Cube H. And also if any enhancement discovered they will also focus on a joint effort to develop
00:19:06 [W] So brief about the errors are areas of focus are I'm easy relevant services to basically our service Discovery and communication between cloud and age or between different age Network and also like make the services
00:19:13 [W] Able to work when the agent cloudbees disconnected and also the MVC relevant networking.
00:19:17 [W] So basically this one is trying to expose more Telco capabilities to The Container Network or to Dr. To the service level.
00:19:26 [W] So make the advantages able to benefit more from the underlying Network information.
00:19:33 [W] is locations the also the security functionalities Etc and also for the me see
00:19:40 [W] sure. So this one is actually basically trying to support various Hardware acceleration or also the multi MPC and the multi connects cluster management and those also to support various kind of workloads
00:19:55 [W] Dr. So this one is actually a basically trying to support various Hardware acceleration and also the Mighty Mac and the multicolored next cluster management and also to support various kind of workloads
00:20:16 [W] so like for example the iot F so this signal will not directly develop the user plan of action functionality, which is actually a part of more mecir business thing, but it will we will try to
00:20:32 [W] Thank you H to make it a better other line platform that support that leverage to the Embassy workloads and business.
00:20:39 [W] So if you would like to know more about it, please visit the online Link to go through DEC translator. And what's also we have a dedicated select channel for this sig.
00:20:54 [W] So one of the reasons work the meac Sig is working on is that the reference staff?
00:21:00 [W] Texture building Mac platform on top of to Analyse and kubeedge.
00:21:06 [W] So the so actually we are borrowing a lot of Concepts already defined by the gsma operator platform.
00:21:21 [W] The uh, Northbound interface and also the user network interface and also the east west east to west broadcasting
00:21:35 [W] And also the southbound in the face, so basically it's defining how the ah, the service is the key components to how did they communicate with the other part?
00:21:39 [W] So the blue boxes are components there will be provided by qh, so actually you will find out there are some of the boxes new to the which have texture.
00:21:53 [W] So kubeedge would basically focus on the following features, like for example, the cross age cloud service Discovery and also the nearby access the basically means the make it possible for the application to know the
00:22:09 [W] Vision of itself and better serve the user technos. So the sodium and user terminal they can get access to the to a nearby application and also the win
00:22:21 [W] Cross application cross container communication happens it will try to deal with the network locality to save the to save the global Network bandwidth.
00:22:22 [W] And also the SRM based on 5G Network events and and then each service Discovery.
00:22:30 [W] It will increment the odd Dynamic resource to actually elastic scaly and the fellow ver sort of capabilities. And also the age mesh will cover from l32 L7 cross h
00:22:45 [W] ovhcloud network streaming and also Mike microservices governess traffic governess and also the Northbound interface because that's that's actually affect affecting the developer experience and also the
00:22:57 [W] DEA developer experience and also the publication computation mechanism
00:22:56 [W] This way this one is the you are working in progress and we are doing a lot of a lot of cross community discussion with the other organizations and other open source projects.
00:23:07 [W] If you are interested in this, please join the MCC select to to to to to join the discussion.
00:23:15 [W] the seek device iot is responsible to simplify and develop and maintain the extensible device.
00:23:26 [W] Total framework and also in the kubeedge community. We will provide some of the are the device critical converter implementations and also make least make it very easy for the other developers to develop their own.
00:23:42 [W] Extensible device protocol framework and also in the kubeedge community. We will provide some of the are the device crotteau converter implementations and also make least make it very
00:24:13 [W] Coverages to any way to kubeedge. So some of the items here are the communique of instruction basically the u.s. Model and the devices apis and also the device controller
00:24:28 [W] Listen every framework.
00:24:29 [W] That's we need to keep improving. The accessibility makes it much more easier for the iot cases.
00:24:37 [W] So the first thing we want to include more integrated more and more diverse protocols second thing. We want to include more integrated more functionalities like data pipeline datadog workflow on the age
00:24:53 [W] Zeebo to specify some of the hardware future software filter to reduce our convert from bloody it too many for data and then sent forward to the business applications.
00:25:02 [W] And another thing is about the data management.
00:25:05 [W] So we know that the devices are producing a lot of especially the time stereo our data. So even it's very expensive to send all of them to the central cloudbees Kappa system them.
00:25:20 [W] H and also for the mapper development, so the Sig will try to simplify and improve the method design and provide reference implementation SDK or Cooks skeleton and lastly The Stig is also I will also work on
00:25:36 [W] Unity Corporation try to educate with other iot a projects and also verify her operator into our ability and a compatibility with the the other projects and the devices.
00:25:47 [W] The Sig we also have a Decay the Left Channel on slack.
00:25:46 [W] So if you some of the our recent work done by device iot Sig are the improvements of device they can so we basically simplify the the definition of adding.
00:26:02 [W] The definition of adding specific customized industrial protocol and also added new Fields clatter lifecycle classic clip the cycle and the report cycle
00:26:16 [W] Click the cycle and the report cycle four different property visitors.
00:26:22 [W] So in some cases the data the property collection period and at the property report Purity might be different. And also we introduced the data section to to help users Define what a kind of data they want to persistent on
00:26:37 [W] On the edge and also integrated with some data processing workflow.
00:26:44 [W] So the awful proposal can be found with the underlined link and also another thing is that we recently simply find the separate design reference.
00:26:54 [W] We are in the in the kubeedge 1 5 release.
00:26:59 [W] also recorded a reflector that the modbus mapper implementation to reflect the video design reference.
00:27:09 [W] Some of the other updates are setup and imitability maintainability.
00:27:14 [W] So the new releases this year. We introduced the D componentconfig.
00:27:21 [W] It's actually the same concept of two communities componentconfig.
00:27:26 [W] So basically we added the community style API to to simplify the componentconfig ratio and also added the two commands to generate.
00:27:37 [W] Coffee is with default values for the no notice stepped up.
00:27:41 [W] We basically deal with the automation of the restoration and the TRS enforcement and also the certificate of rotation and for the smaller the Kata me we added support with Center West rest of Ambien and
00:27:57 [W] And this year we added the HOA support of for its active standby mode, but actually it can serve one canonical reactive canonical instance can support
00:28:12 [W] So the community council you are under design and discussion to design the scale-up model for the cloud for and also we proved that the message delivery and reliability between cloud and H. So basically introduce the application layer
00:28:16 [W] Verification to make sure the there's no a message last when communicating between ground and age so runtime and observability updates. We this year. We have finished the we actually supported more.
00:28:27 [W] Just avoid the are the Mainframe.
00:28:26 [W] Oh see I can ferment can runtime including cryo kind of an endless journey, dr. And Community we supported last year both x86 and arm architecture including armed vv7 and
00:28:42 [W] Both x86 and arm architecture including armed V V7 and V8 are verified and for the observability we added support to use to Colorado locks to fetch
00:28:55 [W] for the observability we added support to use Kudo lakhs to Veterans from Parts on the age and also added support to to use metrics over to collect the metrics metrics from notes in the above
00:29:10 [W] Aah and also he won the fight we added support of using Kudo xec to access a pot on the Edge from the from the cloud from the API server in the cloud.
00:29:23 [W] So that's where we are useful for the application developers to to develop their applications on the old age.
00:29:30 [W] old age. Well not going to the to the actual place of the conserve their so for the use case, let me just share one the largest
00:29:39 [W] So in the China has a highway are the previous tolling mechanism is actually by manual. The efficiency is very low and the upgrading operation expenses are very high and also sometimes they were there are some
00:29:55 [W] Efficient happens so here the new digital transformation progress, uh together with communities helped the whole cluster deployment. So
00:30:09 [W] XD are cancer survivors and also some of the x86 industry PC So currently the application is running on the edge notes are talking 10 the car current plate
00:30:16 [W] Applications so the devices on the HR actually are some of the cameras and also PR the gates.
00:30:24 [W] So in the end the benefits are included the traffic efficiency with ten times more. So for the cost going through the toad toad station, it's down from optimize the down from
00:30:39 [W] And also the truck tekton solution of chart also improved a lot the highlights here are the achieved a very low end to end latency because it's very distributed system or over the
00:30:52 [W] Just different cities of China.
00:30:51 [W] It's very highly distributed.
00:30:52 [W] So the whole system currently there are 100,000 1806 and around the 1 million applications.
00:31:01 [W] So with kubernative static, uh, Dr. The operating our team the benefiting from the unified management experience and can upgrade or scale out the applications
00:31:16 [W] Each in a very easy way and also on top of the infrastructure we mapped it at a distant fourth in the application layer to map the Iraqi management to the different Departments of the
00:31:29 [W] Map of the Iraqi management to the different Departments of the traffic controlling and the traffic management.
00:31:30 [W] So for future plan technical things, we will keep working on providing for subnet to Vacation support, especially for the applications running on the edge.
00:31:42 [W] And also we will support the a chance the cloud Communications integration integrating with existing cni-genie Envoy to to serve
00:31:53 [W] Better at the microservices and for the devices. We will have more we will keep improve the framework extensibility and also and more device protocol Integrations and
00:32:09 [W] Provide the decentralized and security for applications on the edge so they can do the authentication and authorization even is connected to these connected to the central cloud.
00:32:19 [W] And also we are working on in communities working on to provide the framework for underlying framework to serve tea each and a cloud a eye coordination.
00:32:30 [W] So from the community while we will try to provide that area to rebuild experience and also
00:32:38 [W] host a more computer events and also more cross community collaboration.
00:32:43 [W] All right.
00:32:44 [W] These are a few useful or Community Resources.
00:32:48 [W] So we have website and the most of the work actually are done on guitar and Slots left.
00:32:56 [W] So if you have any questions, we welcome you to open an issue on the table or just send message in this lecture. Now, we also have the
00:33:08 [W] Mu C and the device iot seek channel link here. If you are interested in the works there working on. Please feel free to join and we're currently hosts the Indian Community meeting every week alternate between
00:33:23 [W] And the Pacific friendly time you can check out with the to check out the details with the meeting calendar.
00:33:26 [W] also we are recently working on at the community documentation to support multiple releases and also multiple languages. If you are interested in improving the document, please feel free to join.
00:33:41 [W] All right.
00:33:42 [W] Let's worry about the presentation.
00:33:45 [W] So if you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the zoo meeting or join the kubeedge community to ask questions there. Thank you.
