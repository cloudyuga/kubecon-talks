00:00:00 [W] Hey everyone.
00:00:01 [W] It's one of my favorite days.
00:00:04 [W] It's a pancake breakfast day. And today sponsored by accurate X. We have a discussion about immutable security immutable infrastructure goes to the immutable security and it's
00:00:19 [W] Hot hot hot so let me just get the guests right on and then I think we're going to have to have a little something to eat here.
00:00:26 [W] So first off I want to introduce own motion Donnie CTO of accurate Salome. How are you?
00:00:36 [W] Hey, can you hear me?
00:00:38 [W] Certainly? Can I'm doing great.
00:00:42 [W] Absolutely.
00:00:42 [W] Thank you for having me.
00:00:43 [W] I like the apron your the first pancake breakfast intending to come with an apron and I am impressed not on the apron. Mom cakes are going to get live weeping cream and look at
00:00:58 [W] Then I'm loving this next up.
00:00:58 [W] We have Rosemary Wang developer Advocate at hashicorp Rosemary.
00:01:03 [W] Hello.
00:01:04 [W] Hello?
00:01:05 [W] Hello and welcome to our pancake breakfast.
00:01:11 [W] I hope you have a little something there.
00:01:13 [W] I do.
00:01:14 [W] I have my Giant spatula bachelor, which I use to make my lovely pancakes, but we're going to playing today just maple syrup.
00:01:27 [W] Perfect. And up. Next is Krishna bug of a Thule bike mutulu CTO for the NBA Kyler.
00:01:38 [W] How are you?
00:01:39 [W] Good.
00:01:40 [W] How are you?
00:01:41 [W] Krishna?
00:01:41 [W] Nice to see you here.
00:01:42 [W] likewise.
00:01:44 [W] I got some you know pumpkin spice maple syrup from Vermont that I also have a spatula if you guys can see this. This is an LA Laker spok.
00:01:55 [W] Cooler for obvious reasons.
00:01:57 [W] Ah, yes the Lakers where we just were wondering if LeBron is a pancake fan and our guess is yes and chintzy.
00:02:06 [W] Why managing General partner rain Capital Jensen great to see you again Hi, how are you Alex?
00:02:13 [W] I've got my coffee and I've got my syrup.
00:02:19 [W] It's prickly pear syrup.
00:02:21 [W] Thank you.
00:02:19 [W] I like it.
00:02:23 [W] I like it.
00:02:23 [W] I like it and Priyanka Sharma general manager of the cloudevents yuting foundation.
00:02:28 [W] Hello, Priyanka.
00:02:29 [W] Hello. Everyone.
00:02:31 [W] Very nice to see you at coupon Cloud native gone North America and I have with me maple syrup as well because I am a very big obliging pancakes are not pancakes without it and also some additional topping. Whoops.
00:02:46 [W] Sorry blowing the wrong Bon Marche my Maan
00:02:48 [W] Orange marmalade, I'm a big fan of this brand.
00:02:52 [W] Oh, I'm a n**** now. I'm promoting it.
00:02:55 [W] Oh, hi, this is just orange but there's strawberry is what I love the most. So you're in you have the CERN collider behind your the are you having particle pancakes as Sue this morning?
00:03:10 [W] Vertigo pancakes. Well, so sorry.
00:03:03 [W] I'm sorry does a ton of work with Cloud native Technologies and they have like Kino did in Basquiat a cube cons Etc.
00:03:13 [W] So whenever I have a call with them, I turn on this virtual background and feel inspired like I'm in the middle of science right now.
00:03:22 [W] It's just it's a you know, it's because I recently had a call with them.
00:03:25 [W] Well, you know, Krishna, I don't think Rook.
00:03:29 [W] Zuri has any syrup, you want to pass the syrup up to up to Rosemary that put mirror or see how they try the oh, there you go.
00:03:36 [W] Perfect.
00:03:37 [W] Okay.
00:03:38 [W] Hey, um, can you pass me?
00:03:41 [W] Can you pass me or maybe well who has some syrup there are so whipped cream.
00:03:45 [W] Oh, I've got a I've got some but that's kind of a maple game.
00:03:51 [W] There's a lot of maple we have well, thank you very much. I think you know, I, you know, it was one of those particle physics saying we're went from whipped cream, too.
00:03:59 [W] The maple syrup.
00:04:00 [W] How about that?
00:04:01 [W] Talk about what you know the live the live effects here.
00:04:05 [W] So anyone else have anything that they want to they have to share with us?
00:04:11 [W] Is there any butter? Does anyone have any butter and the I believe so yeah, I've got some butter. Okay.
00:04:18 [W] Thanks.
00:04:18 [W] Just pass it over and pop in.
00:04:21 [W] Okay.
00:04:21 [W] It's on the table over there. I'm going to take a try on my pancakes here and then we'll just get started anyone else.
00:04:26 [W] Mmm, let me put these aside for later.
00:04:31 [W] I brought my spatula to but let's just get started.
00:04:36 [W] Our topic today is immutable security immutable security is an interesting topic firm for us over here at the new stack. It goes into kind of the where where we are today.
00:04:49 [W] I think in the almost the the continuing life of Claudia Technologies.
00:04:56 [W] And we would not have been talking about security very much a few years ago.
00:05:00 [W] There was a people's mind and sure was in the people's mind who was actually thinking about putting this in production.
00:05:05 [W] But today it's a little bit of a different story and I wanted to share something from PS Sharma who's a Acuras co-founder and chief product officer might give us some context here. And again, I just want to thank God corrects for sponsoring this
00:05:20 [W] Chief product officer might give us some context here. And again, I just wanted to thank accurate for sponsoring this pancake breakfast at Cube column.
00:05:18 [W] And you're let me read it for you as organizations rapidly adopt new technology such as serverless containers and servicemeshcon.
00:05:48 [W] Where infrastructure configurations must be managed for risk through code risk through Co that's an interesting topic.
00:05:55 [W] Unfortunately, most organizations do allowed changes infrastructure configurations and runtime which breaks immutability accurate enables immutable security by programmatically detecting and resolving
00:06:11 [W] Cross infrastructure as code before infrastructure is provision and maintains the posture in runtime by programmatically programmatically mitigating risks through IAC. So
00:06:26 [W] So I want to maybe just go right to you.
00:06:28 [W] Oh and just talk about this concept a little bit and you know for for people out there, we're really seeing much more attack Services open up and that will just only increase as immutable Securities, but mirror will have a structure becomes.
00:06:43 [W] are widespread I my question is what role what role does this do these contests play, you know inside inside end user environments right now and who's responsible who has
00:06:50 [W] Who has what roles?
00:06:47 [W] What are the Persona is that they play? What is that developer experience that really is required.
00:06:53 [W] So it things don't get lost and and troubles arise right?
00:07:00 [W] I mean Alex, you know fundamentally.
00:07:03 [W] What are we observing today, you know in terms of immutable infrastructure out there.
00:07:07 [W] is that even immutable infrastructure is being built in layers, right? So if you are today,
00:07:15 [W] Day trying to you know deploy a traditional Cloud native architecture say on a public Cloud environment, right? You would see a few layers going into it.
00:07:26 [W] You will see a cloud layer on top of it.
00:07:29 [W] You will see kubernative Slayer and then on top of it you could see another layer which can be a servicemeshcon are using linkerd e or, you know, even serverless layer on top of it.
00:07:39 [W] So you have multiple layers now in your Cloud native infrastructure in all these layers now.
00:07:45 [W] You know you are coming with immutability built into them as design.
00:07:50 [W] So what what does immutability in this context, you know means well fundamentally. What it means is that there is going to be single source of Truth when it comes to change management, right and what strategies like rip and replace
00:08:05 [W] Fundamentally what it means is that there is going to be single source of Truth when it comes to change management, right and what strategies like rip and replace are going to take over and instead of people making changes directly
00:08:18 [W] Instead of people making changes directly into your runtime environment.
00:08:21 [W] They will be make changes using the single source of Truth and that could be anything but that also could be infrastructure as code.
00:08:28 [W] So now when the infrastructures are being developed and deployed there are multiple teams here multiple roles here which are working together.
00:08:37 [W] So you have your traditional devops team, which is converging more and more towards, you know development. They are writing active code now in terms of infrastructure as code.
00:08:47 [W] To Define as well as to you know, declaratively, you know mention all the configuration settings in code and codify the cloud representation or the cloud native infrastructure representations.
00:09:01 [W] So you have developed steams on one side developing code and then you have Ops teams deploying it and then you have of course the security teams who are responsible in some way or shape to deliver security or this architecture not just in the development
00:09:17 [W] During the runtime.
00:09:18 [W] So these are the predominant three different personas which are playing the game in tandem with each other because of the immutable infrastructures that have emerged.
00:09:30 [W] Are you I do you buy this Chauncey?
00:09:34 [W] Ah, ha ha ha.
00:09:35 [W] I was going to say let's hope there's one single source of truth because with infrastructures code I think we can get there.
00:09:46 [W] There's the instrument is there but what you see in real production environment, even if you have terraform you have kubernative Zoar chef and puppet what you get is you've got this developer is
00:10:02 [W] Jacked into the Container in runtime and change things and nobody knows about so in mutable infrastructure immutable production environment is a great concept, but let's make it happen in a way.
00:10:10 [W] Beautiful production environment is a great concept but let's make it happen in a way that's manageable and all of us security operations can benefit from it.
00:10:15 [W] So Krishna when you're thinking about this you think about security at step 7 of 10 for of 10 6 of 10 to of 2009 and freshen those the one thing I'll say right is
00:10:30 [W] We'll say right is I think this this Nirvana or this pursuit of immutability, right?
00:10:37 [W] He's been around for a while.
00:10:39 [W] I'm an old guy right?
00:10:40 [W] I've you know, I we Face some of you have worked in Java and violence, you know that back in the day when we were deploying web archives or War files.
00:10:49 [W] The intent was that's an immutable War file that goes across multiple environments, right? That's not the case you and I know that so I think I think you know in our inner ear.
00:11:00 [W] We've at least in my group. We we have that direct attack in our wind, right?
00:11:07 [W] We know that that's what we want to achieve and we are shifting our priorities as we think about developing applications.
00:11:15 [W] There's this huge mindset shift, right?
00:11:17 [W] I mean people talk about the shift left mindset and we have adopted that but you know, that's I'm not saying that we have solved all the problems.
00:11:25 [W] I'm just saying that yes security is definitely a first class.
00:11:30 [W] Citizen or at least attempting to be it's no longer as you know, 7th class or step 7 citizen at least at least in environments that I've been working in for the last three to four years so that that's certainly changed.
00:11:46 [W] Rosemary, you know you work in the world of hashicorp, which is a which is a soft becoming a software Powerhouse and itself and you must be thinking all the time about these types of issues.
00:11:59 [W] Class citizen or at least attempting to be it's no longer as you know, 7th class or step 7 citizen at least at least in environments that I've been working in for the last three to four years so that that certainly changed.
00:12:50 [W] Are making software, you know from your perspective where does security sit and is it a you know antara form is so well known as infrastructure as code environment, but there's also so much policy that we need to think about as
00:13:05 [W] No, one terraform is so well known as infrastructure as code environment, but there's also so much policy that we need to think about as well.
00:13:13 [W] I think that it is something that's easier to do.
00:13:19 [W] We're making tools that make it easier to communicate the intent of what we're looking for, right?
00:13:25 [W] I think security is not necessarily fully difficult because of a technical constraint. It's kind of constraint of
00:13:35 [W] Ocean you don't know what you don't know.
00:13:37 [W] I think even when I wasn't necessarily using hashicorp tools as someone who was a systems engineer.
00:13:44 [W] I didn't really know.
00:13:46 [W] What was the consequence of let's say exposing an S3 bucket with metadata and policy is one of the ways that you communicate and you teach proper infrastructure as code and by extension immutability.
00:13:58 [W] think that it's a really great way to communicate what your organization is looking for across.
00:14:05 [W] Anybody who's doing infrastructure as code is Bianca what's all this talk about open policy agent. What if I keep hearing this come up quite a bit.
00:14:15 [W] What what's going on over there?
00:14:18 [W] Well, you know, why?
00:14:19 [W] What's why is this getting such popularity as a project?
00:14:23 [W] Yes Bell at the end of the day.
00:14:26 [W] It's about like you know the market size right now everyone we've talked to right we have NB C. NB C. NB a-- over here.
00:14:34 [W] We have hashicorp ever. Everyone is telling us how people need to understand what's going on.
00:14:40 [W] Eloquently things like Opa or Opa are able to teach that to the the rank-and-file developers the rank-and-file admin person all in one go like the same information as seen propagated across
00:14:56 [W] X off an organization and I think that is huge that is why things like Opa are becoming so successful.
00:14:48 [W] It's solving a real need and I mean it's one of the very highly used projects in the cncf. If there is a new stuff coming out all the time. Just I think it was today that they had an Envoy integration that came
00:15:04 [W] Very highly used projects in the cncf if there is a new stuff coming out all the time.
00:15:05 [W] Just I think it was today that they had an Envoy integration that came out which is awesome because Envoy has the river reverse proxy sits at the core of so buy stuff and can propagate all this Opa policies to
00:15:20 [W] It's at the core of so buy stuff and can propagate all this Opa policies to different parts of the system to different people so lots of movement lots of growth and usage. Why because it's a real problem.
00:15:34 [W] Everybody needs to be on the same page and opa is one step towards a single source of Truth.
00:15:40 [W] Well, go ahead Chauncey having thoughts.
00:15:45 [W] I want to I want to know one thing Alex, you know you and I have been talking about this.
00:15:50 [W] So of in this face for a long time, right we have met what 2015?
00:15:56 [W] Yeah.
00:15:56 [W] It's a coffee shop in San Francisco and I was pitching to you the idea of immutable security back in 2015, right?
00:16:05 [W] so are we hearing that we would not would not quite here yet. But we making progress. I think Opa is one step towards the right direction and as I'm a security person I've been security for a long time. It's you
00:16:20 [W] Not deliver Assurance, if you cannot measure something and you cannot measure something that you cannot specify so I think Opa and others that giving a static way of describing and and
00:16:35 [W] Step towards the right direction and as I'm a security president security for a long time, it's you cannot deliver Assurance. If you cannot measure something and you cannot measure something that you cannot specify so
00:17:10 [W] Actually environment is exactly what we need for immutable security to have we're getting somewhere.
00:17:18 [W] I think now that brings up some other topics. I have in the back of my mind this idea of comparisons that can be made here Rome and when you're thinking about that and then I want to touch on remediation
00:17:33 [W] Mother topic say I have in the back of my mind this idea of comparisons that can be made here Rome and when you're thinking about that and then I want to touch on remediation as a CO, which is another
00:18:07 [W] Which is another phrase that you're thrown at us over from accurate X and I need to get my head around this but let's let's talk about these comparisons first because you can't I was thinking about this
00:18:22 [W] Today after we had a bit of a chat and I was thinking, you know, you know what really can you do without any comparison? You can't really do really anything and so I think one of the things that I find least in our world is we
00:18:37 [W] Like the topic and we and then you start talking or technologists and saying well, you know that we got those have to think about this project. We had to think about this really so context in comparison is always there so our thinking about immutable security.
00:18:49 [W] What does that context?
00:18:50 [W] What does that comparison that needs to be made? We think about infrastructure as code when you're thinking about Opa you're thinking of other issues that come up when you're running very complicated microservices in production.
00:19:03 [W] Yeah, so, you know Opa is one of the you know backbone.
00:19:08 [W] I would say technologies that you know, we also use it at corrects and its really revolutionary, you know, the way Opa was designed and how it is helping now.
00:19:18 [W] We were one of the first ones to adopted but here's the thing about comparison that you are, you know, alluding to so imagine that you are trying to deploy a multi-layer cloudevents structure. You are using terraform for deploying your
00:19:33 [W] Cloud infrastructure your computer network storage and then you are using your say hemp shots to deploy your kubernative customers and then we're using openfaas CML to deploy, you know more microservices on top of it now all these three different
00:19:48 [W] Technologies if you're using that right just imagine they are so much polyglot in nature.
00:19:51 [W] They are different but you are using all three of them to deploy the same cluster of the same Cloud native infrastructure on top of it.
00:20:01 [W] Which will you will run your applications. Now what Opa does here is that it opens up the doors for comparisons.
00:20:08 [W] So just imagine all your decorative configurations are defined in this Rich infrastructure as code your terraform your hem chart.
00:20:16 [W] Your openfaas Yama files.
00:20:18 [W] They've got all the definitions for all the resources that you would have deployed.
00:20:21 [W] That's your, you know, single source of truth if that adoption is kind of moving forward and then use Opa to bring all these polyglot infrastructure as code Technologies together apply the policies for
00:20:36 [W] The OPA can basically allow you to do these comparisons in a very very seamless way.
00:20:30 [W] I believe it's a de facto standard today in Industry to do policy as code.
00:20:35 [W] Of course, it was designed for a purpose to do certain kind of, you know, admission controller-based use cases, but we take an Opa to next level in our product. We use it to, you know, make comparisons with terraform with you know
00:20:50 [W] - templates with cfd but many other infrastructure as code Technologies.
00:20:41 [W] So that's what is your comparison piece.
00:20:44 [W] But what is also important in the immutability space the security problems that you are facing are going to be majorly what Cheng zhi was alluding to of drifts.
00:20:54 [W] So it's not just going to be the Security based policy is code use cases, but you see when the developers develop steams Ops teams when they're going to address break the glass.
00:21:06 [W] Science or imagined see situations they going to go and make direct changes into your clusters into your Cloud environments.
00:21:12 [W] You need to be able to also make comparisons of those changes that are happening identify those drips and then address them those lips can be very very dangerous.
00:21:21 [W] A lot of breaches have happened because of the drifts that have been caused between infrastructure as code and cloud and also between your previous versions of your Cloud native architecture and the latest version of it. So that's how as a CF Rose. Where are we talking about?
00:21:36 [W] Jobs here doesn't have this kind of sounds like gitops like, you know roll, you know, you can just roll it back just roll it back and you know, so you can keep reaching that desired state is that remediation is code then is it really just gitops?
00:21:49 [W] I think it is, but I also think it's not just a rollback. It's constantly rolling forward.
00:21:54 [W] That's the intent behind immutability and the first place you're never reverting back to a previous state.
00:22:00 [W] Out and also between your previous versions of your Cloud native architecture and the latest version of it.
00:21:59 [W] That's why there's a CF rows. Where are we talking about gitops here doesn't have this kind of sounds like gitops like, you know roll, you know, you can just roll it back just roll it back and you know, so you can keep reaching that desired state is that remediation is code then
00:22:58 [W] Call at its core is very much about let's roll forward.
00:23:02 [W] Let's make changes that override a previous state so that we can actually secure something or we can get to a desired state.
00:23:10 [W] So it's really fascinating. I think about measuring Thrift or even sort of the idea of security architecture is that there's a deviation from how far you expect your security to be and then the actual security of
00:23:26 [W] even sort of the idea of security architecture is that there's a deviation from how far you expect your security to be and then the actual security of your infrastructure or any kind of
00:23:43 [W] Picture or any kind of application that you're running so measuring that and closing the drift is really part of really core part of continuously measuring that and that's the part of remediation that is often missed.
00:23:58 [W] It's continuous.
00:23:59 [W] Hmm.
00:24:00 [W] There's a quick thought Alex on that if I can just add that.
00:24:05 [W] You know what Rosemary said, I mean look at the emerging projects that are coming up. I'm in the sandbox project in cncf today, which is flux CD, right?
00:24:13 [W] Right in my opinion, you know, these are the kind of Technologies which are going to enable a lot of remediation is code base, you know implementations, you know, these these Technologies which are I mean, I like to call them,
00:24:28 [W] Out stealth clustered continuous deployment, you know projects which allow you to continuously do gitops by remaining within the cluster itself.
00:24:38 [W] No need to manage separate infrastructure for your gitops, you know, deployments or operations.
00:24:44 [W] I think these are the technology which are sitting as Gatekeepers for immutability to be maintained because they pull all the infrastructure as code and automatically deploy your clusters at the I Envision that these technologies will receive sysdig.
00:24:58 [W] Security capabilities also to identify the security gaps using policies code and do in line remediation as well.
00:25:06 [W] I mean, once that maturity level is achieved. I see that you know, these technologies will evolve into you know hub for doing remedy shares code and self-healing.
00:25:16 [W] I hope you folks are considering contributing to flux and Argo and because your vision is awesome, and you're absolutely right.
00:25:26 [W] That's the direction. The wave is going to reverse the date got sandbox. My eyes were popping up like my God if this is something that I can just pull in so great for a Sandbox project, right because they come in with basically just a neutral
00:25:41 [W] And a space where people can trust and collaborate and that's exactly what you proved out right there where you're like you saw it and you're like, yeah I can pull this in so that's great news crazy.
00:25:44 [W] I think we're on the same team here because you know, you gotta be a little skeptical of all this, you know, talk of trust and happiness and immutability.
00:25:54 [W] I mean you talked about Nirvana earlier.
00:25:57 [W] I mean really, what's the reality here about remediation and you know and all these kind of like lofty lofty.
00:26:04 [W] Is that we have streaming around here. Well, I just say that you know, I think in today's landscape, right there's there's certainly a lot of preventive or reactive techniques to secure our infrastructure, but we certainly need more proactive
00:26:19 [W] I think we're used to mediation of is covered as is really interesting.
00:26:13 [W] You know, I think I think the containerization microservices they were all given us the ability to package and deploy at scale. Right and then we like many others like I mentioned earlier right?
00:26:25 [W] We have embraced the shift to Cloud native environments actually in the midst of the pandemic just to just to sort of set a little bit broader context, right? We in April of this year. We announced a large partnership with Microsoft to essentially create.
00:26:39 [W] A direct-to-consumer platform that will deliver essentially a new way for our fans to engage with our content and we have on that Journey right now.
00:26:47 [W] We want to build a completely from the ground up Innovative direct-to-consumer platform in the cloud that will actually deliver personalized game broadcasts and other content offerings, you know, integrating various products and services across
00:27:03 [W] To our fans.
00:26:56 [W] We are calling it the next-gen platform for now inventive name, but but you know as we look at doing this, right clearly our Cloud footprint or the number of Pancakes there are cooking is
00:27:11 [W] Exponentially and we want to make sure it's secure so so, you know, I also thought it was interesting.
00:27:09 [W] I think one of you mentioned break the glass approach to your deployments when that happens, right?
00:27:16 [W] I think we need policies that are closely aligned with our architecture.
00:27:20 [W] That's why I find these concept that some of you mentioned earlier, you know immutable security for immutable architectures.
00:27:31 [W] I think that's interesting and that
00:27:33 [W] that's the approach along with remediation that I believe is the approach that will set us up for the future Chauncey.
00:27:42 [W] You you live in a in a in a world where you're looking at security issues all the time.
00:27:47 [W] You have a deep background as an academic and security you have been investing in security companies your practice technologist when you think about the complexity of microservices, and we
00:28:02 [W] Of microservices and sometimes you can have microservices at the most complex as you know, multiple multiple layers.
00:28:07 [W] And so then you have a degree of complexity and Chaos that is unprecedented really for I think for people to manage so we get into kind of conversations about well, what can you actually
00:28:22 [W] What can you actually for see? What can you actually understand about your current infrastructure?
00:28:19 [W] What do you what do you get from this conversation that speaks to that that need to have that breach path prediction so to speak?
00:28:28 [W] Yeah. So breach path prediction has been a concept fairly popular in the security industry, and I actually think it's a misnomer even though so it's understandable you can relate
00:28:42 [W] A to what that is, but the reason I think it's a misnomer is that there's just never a single path to breach, right? So there are many many different path and it's all about what you can do when there's
00:28:57 [W] Misnomer is that there's just never a single path to breach, right?
00:28:57 [W] So there are many many different path and it's all about what you can do when there's our symptoms happening or their events that are happening. Now if I may pull back a little bit secure. I've been in security for a long time and
00:29:13 [W] Now if I may pull back a little bit secure, I've been in security for a long time and security technology typically fall into two buckets one is I call the hygiene.
00:29:25 [W] It is about helping everyone getting environment to the best date that you can and don't make any mistakes and then get into production.
00:29:35 [W] That's one the second category is about dealing with threats.
00:29:39 [W] It's dealing with a known and threats now.
00:29:42 [W] Guess what about maybe 70 80 percent, maybe even more than 80% of security breaches are due to not doing the hygiene.
00:29:51 [W] Well, all right, so it's all low hanging fruit that somebody made a mistake in configuration. Somebody Jen write a piece of code in the way.
00:30:00 [W] that should be a very easy stuff. I think this immutable info structure and infrastructures code and policy as code.
00:30:08 [W] really pushes the state of
00:30:12 [W] All right forward in terms of heightened security hygiene. Now if we've done that well, then what's left to do is hopefully in production you have not only smaller attack surface, but you also have a
00:30:28 [W] continuously monitor by as Rosemary said earlier that really what you need to do is understand at any given time if your state has sort of drifted from the known good
00:30:43 [W] Think about it do something really fast.
00:30:25 [W] So my thinking for and lot of modern infrastructure security folks would agree with me is do your hygiene. Well, then in production detect failure fast fail fast at
00:30:40 [W] On production detect failure fast fail fast at recover fast and that's what you need to do.
00:30:46 [W] And that's the way to deal with complexity.
00:30:48 [W] And when you have all these microservices going on if you can localize the effect and basically remediate locally and changing these components really fast and without impacting the larger environment
00:31:04 [W] Components really fast and without impacting the larger environment then you wet Rosemary. When when I think about this I think about the work that hashicorp does and one of the things that
00:31:19 [W] Hashicorp does and one of the things that you mentioned in a conversation we I had with you and the rest of the group we're talking about Co defying the cluster and how you met codify relationships and
00:31:33 [W] Koda find the cluster and how you met codify relationships and perhaps you could tell us about you know, how that fits with the approach that accuracy is taking when you're thinking about remediation is a
00:31:48 [W] Thinking about remediation as a CO but also these relationships and this Fitness that chance he's discussing.
00:31:56 [W] Yeah say there is a fantastic concept called evolutionary architecture not mine.
00:32:02 [W] There's even a book on it and it more broadly address is this idea that you have expectations of your architecture whether they be compliance expectations security expectations resource expectations cost.
00:32:17 [W] Even I think that all of these fit together and the measurement by which you understand how far you deviated from that architecture is a fitness function. So both remediation is code and policy is code and some of the work that accurate sysdig
00:32:32 [W] Isis this visibility into a fitness fashion.
00:32:32 [W] What are the deviations?
00:32:34 [W] how far are we from this expected architecture that we have? It's not to say that it's perfect and it's not to say you know that we have accomplished achieve this ideal architecture either.
00:32:44 [W] It's to demonstrate and make visible the you know, the differences between what you expect and what you actually have. Oh moving back to the conversation about
00:32:57 [W] You know shifting left for instance and when we think about shifting left and I guess when we talk about expectations as well, we think about you know, these expectations that we all have of ourselves and each other when it comes to
00:33:12 [W] The but what rules are shifting left play and what is the what are the other things that need to be thought of when you're thinking about shifting left?
00:33:19 [W] And a lot of our talking about here is is self-healing really and so I'm wondering how the developer experience is intersecting kind of with these Concepts look, you know, one of the very important aspects that have to be taken care of.
00:33:35 [W] whenever shift left strategies are adopted or new products or Technologies of pushed in that direction is to ensure that no new processes or at least the impact on the existing processes for the people who are
00:33:43 [W] Which are mostly the developers and to some extent devops folks as well are not impacted too much.
00:33:42 [W] So if there is a strategy which requires existing processes to be changed that is going to have a direct impact on the velocity of the developers.
00:33:52 [W] That means your shift left is going to now require to adopt new ways to do things.
00:33:58 [W] That is a big barrier for adopting any kind of shift left strategy or technology.
00:34:06 [W] So that's a very important point that if you are attempting to shift left any outcome that you were achieving previously by being in the middle of being in the right. We need to ensure that that shift is done
00:34:21 [W] So that's a very important point that if you are attempting to shift left any outcome that you were achieving previously by being in the middle of being in the right. We need to ensure that that shift is done
00:34:45 [W] Processes in my as an example when we talk about remediation is code that imitation is code can be performed in multiple different ways.
00:34:55 [W] But if you offer developers methods that do not require any change in the existing process, for example, you you generate a magician as code create a poll request and assign that to the developer instead of you as a
00:35:10 [W] Any change in the existing process? For example, you you generate a magician is code create a pull request and assign that to the developer instead of you as a product. If you have a reputation of code are playing instead of you as a product pressing the
00:35:28 [W] Repetition is called are playing into the you as a product pressing the button on the code to redeploy the new remediated configuration in the cloud allow the developers to take that action and not
00:35:43 [W] New processes.
00:35:44 [W] otherwise you will end up breaking the velocity of developers anything that breaks the velocity of developers that technology even if it is superior fails to get adopted.
00:35:52 [W] That's first problem. Now from the self-healing point of view.
00:35:56 [W] Look what has happened is that you know developers and devops teams are moving at such large speeds that security is just not able to you know, catch up with them.
00:36:06 [W] a reality and as Cheng zhi mentioned right 70% or maybe 80% of the breaches happen.
00:36:13 [W] The principal Factor behind those beaches is the lack of cyber hygiene which are basically the low hanging fruits your you know, your best practices your benchmarks, you know with me easily be detected and implemented
00:36:28 [W] Fight that is where the self-healing infrastructures and the self healing Technologies are moving towards they are not there to solve, you know, all the problems that the security can face but solving all those low hanging
00:36:43 [W] The first Target of course infrastructure as code is enabling it and probably I'll just a few more seconds to quickly give you some real example how it works so that you know, we should also be able to understand, you know going Beyond these jargons, you know what it is.
00:36:50 [W] So take for example, there's a kubernative sequester.
00:36:53 [W] You have one pot running in a you know in a workspace and then you have another pod running another workspace in the namespace. Now when you have these two parts running if one part is interacting say with a database servicemeshcon
00:37:06 [W] Where's the other part is your front end, which is interacting with your web application. Now if today we were to report, you know, any security detection technology when it reports that oh you have this database connection, which is insecure right
00:37:21 [W] With a database service. The other part is your front end which is interacting with your web application. Now if today we were to report, you know any security detection technology when it reports that oh you have this database connection, which is insecure.
00:37:46 [W] Teams as well as a developers team us to fall then I'm going to do anything about it first answer that might get is yeah, we know this but this database is deeply buried in my network.
00:37:56 [W] I have many more security controls on top of it, so don't worry about it.
00:37:59 [W] But the moment you start showcasing that well you have a problem in the database and you also have a problem in another part which is your web application and these two are talking to each other. So if this gets compromised your web application get compromised your databases directly
00:38:14 [W] So when you report these violations which are still the Cyber hygiene related problems in connection with the relationship that they share which we are able to extract now from infrastructure as code even before the you know, the cluster is deployed. We can extract such
00:38:30 [W] That's where you are able to contextualize and make the developers more powerful when you tell them go and fix this problem now because there is a security context that you have attached to it right developers like that because they are not security, you know people
00:38:40 [W] To understand security Beyond a certain extent.
00:38:41 [W] that's where we are helping or the community is helping developers with self healing in infrastructure. So relationship identification and what Rosemary was mentioning, right? These are very important aspects, you know, if you want to shift left, there are Kagome we can
00:38:56 [W] And then I'm done. I'm going to go to Krishna for a last question.
00:38:58 [W] Sure.
00:38:59 [W] Yeah. I just wanted to say that I hundred percent agree that when you're shifting anything left you have to care about the person who is on the left side, which is the developer. Suddenly. They're asking so much more of these people, right? They're supposed to have a handle on operations.
00:39:14 [W] They're not supposed to understand the security workflows.
00:39:16 [W] there's a lot going on and I think from that perspective gitops has been awesome because they are used to the git pull request workflow. And so that I absolutely agree with them is critical that
00:39:28 [W] Where the person on the left is and it'll just get the job done much faster.
00:39:33 [W] And then I think there's also the element of you know, and this kind of zooms out a little bit from this conversation.
00:39:39 [W] We've been having about like all of you here are Wizards technology Wizards who are really deep into this these problems and you know the best way to solve it and you have the smartest ideas, but the average developer is
00:39:54 [W] Hang on this journey, and I think that's where Learning and Development comes in from a cncf and Linux Foundation perspective.
00:40:00 [W] We take it very seriously. And so enabling the communities part of our job. So we have a lot of training programs as folks know for certified to become Kuma Daddy's admins to become kubernative Zach tabs, and now today I mean
00:40:16 [W] Gone, you're going to see just how I like certified kubernative security folks and like what we get what they can do and how they can start signing up and get going and I'm hoping that will be a small help to get each and every
00:40:21 [W] Help to get each and every develop developer comfortable certified on shifting security left.
00:40:26 [W] I'm gonna give us round a spatula Applause for that one way to go looking for important for the community.
00:40:32 [W] I consider myself a cook not a wizard, but I'll take the wizard. But you know what before we go Krista.
00:40:40 [W] There's a certain Wizardry that has to go with identity isn't there when you're trying to when you're thinking of kubernative he's and then because now you have identities of all kinds and all kinds of microservices that are emerging. Right? So identity is a real tough issue. There's no really identity platform.
00:40:56 [W] A for kubernative since so I'm curious how you think about identity issues for those applications and the services, you know, the individuals are another matter entirely. But how do you think about you know, how are you thinking about that when you're going about
00:41:11 [W] To deal with this new project that you're building out a couple different things, right?
00:41:15 [W] The first thing is by gaining visibility into the cloud environment, you know observing the data flows just just using tools that will actually give us more perspective into Data flows, right?
00:41:27 [W] other one is to actually use tools accurate speak one of them for posture assessment Keys assets infrastructure and all of that stuff Chauncey and rosemary just quickly
00:41:41 [W] Would you call identity and access management a mildly hot issue a hot issue or a super hot and it's hot.
00:41:58 [W] Sorry, I can't add more hot stuff that I'm just going to say it's part of me. Like it was it's burning in the pan. It's not easy. Right and it's so I mean identities so difficult access management is even more difficult so I can add more hot
00:42:06 [W] In the pan you can just add the new offering that hashicorp has launched.
00:42:07 [W] Someone would ask.
00:42:07 [W] Yeah, that's partly what boundary boundary which is a new open source project that we have and IT addresses a certain segment of access management as well as some of the other offerings so that's for another day.
00:42:19 [W] Well, you all should check out the live stream we did yesterday where we looked at five projects and demos and one of them was Oak was opa opa.
00:42:29 [W] Say and then we had a Roundtable discussion and guess what came up boundary.
00:42:37 [W] It came up in our talk yesterday.
00:42:39 [W] So like you all are on a roll.
00:42:41 [W] I mean, I mean, let's flip some pancakes for hashicorp.
00:42:44 [W] I mean, this is good stuff.
00:42:46 [W] So I want to just thank you everyone.
00:42:47 [W] Let's get her out of let's go at scratch them a round of applause Hank thank case.
00:42:51 [W] Yay.
00:42:52 [W] Thank you so much everyone for taking the time. This has been a lot of fun and really enjoy this pancake breakfast.
00:42:59 [W] I just want to thank her go around go around the horn here own.
00:43:04 [W] Thank you so much for joining us home is a CTO Daiquiri X Rosemary developer Advocate hashicorp, Krishna CTO of the NBA, you know, my son's a big Carmelo Anthony fan if like, you know, if like we could get like a 101 pancake anything
00:43:19 [W] You know, like any content platform you to building, that'd be that'd be awesome and Chansey Chansey is always a wonderful to have you on the show managing General partner in capital and Priyanka particle pancakes.
00:43:32 [W] I think that's it, you know way to go general manager at cncf.
00:43:36 [W] Thanks everyone for joining us, and we look forward to Q Khan and having a great great show.
00:43:41 [W] Thank you.
00:43:42 [W] Appreciate it.
00:43:43 [W] it. Thank you.
00:43:44 [W] You're cute God.
00:44:29 [W] enjoy
00:44:57 [W] Can you hear me?
00:45:01 [W] We can hear you now.
00:45:03 [W] Great. Okay, so I lost my connection there. So sorry about that. But let's just get started with compressions here.
00:45:10 [W] I wanted to send the first question over to home home question comes in from let's get the name here from appeal.
00:45:22 [W] mwah asks or call asks, how do we handle security and scalability together?
00:45:30 [W] How do we handle those two things?
00:45:34 [W] Right. Can you guys hear me?
00:45:36 [W] Yeah inaudible.
00:45:38 [W] Yep.
00:45:39 [W] All right. Well, so the best way, you know to address this challenge of you know security as scale, especially in the you know, Cloud security space is to make sure that your security
00:45:54 [W] From Kapil Kuma and he asks or call asks, how do we handle security and scalability together?
00:45:54 [W] How do we handle those two things?
00:45:59 [W] Right.
00:46:00 [W] Can you guys hear me?
00:46:00 [W] Yeah, I'm a little yep.
00:46:04 [W] All right. Well, so the best way, you know to address this challenge of you know security as scale, especially in the you know Cloud security space is to make sure that your security
00:46:45 [W] Strong support why well because who's responsible for scaling your Cloud architecture?
00:46:51 [W] Well in most cases it is going to be devops teams, right?
00:46:54 [W] So scalability gets impacted when devops processes expediency mlops and it was very processes under could construct a vast processes that when you're scalability will also take a hit.
00:47:07 [W] So the best strategy to handle this is to a DOT, you know security practices that are designed to ship left such as deaf seccomp and
00:47:15 [W] bake this security into developer life cycle.
00:47:19 [W] Excellent anyone else want to comment on that on security and scalability.
00:47:25 [W] I know at the NBA that's a that's a major concern, isn't it?
00:47:34 [W] Krishna
00:47:38 [W] I think Krishna had to drop unfortunately, Krishna had to drop.
00:47:42 [W] Yes.
00:47:42 [W] That's right.
00:47:42 [W] So so does anyone else have any thoughts about or we could just move on to the next question we can go to let's go to this question from Johannes Josephus.
00:47:56 [W] audriana's the board. And and the question is do policies make it easier to test or visualize runtime security setup of an infrastructure instead of relying on
00:48:07 [W] Just a little Brute Force hacking and security audits.
00:48:12 [W] Why don't we go to you know when we go to you?
00:48:18 [W] What is your perspective on that?
00:48:21 [W] I think that it covers having policies cover a number of sort of pitfalls. You might come across when you're setting up infrastructure, right?
00:48:32 [W] Sometimes it's just you don't know any better.
00:48:34 [W] So I think it covers a good portion of misconfigurations you might have in your infrastructure, but I don't think you can fully rely on it, right?
00:48:44 [W] It's not a hundred percent. You still will you know, you still want to have some security audits right trust but verify
00:48:51 [W] Important and you will you will have scenarios where you will make mutable changes to your infrastructure.
00:48:58 [W] So someone is going in making changes for stability just a patch something really quickly.
00:49:04 [W] And in that case you still want to have some kind of auditing you still want to have someone who is looking and assessing the system with a security mindset as well. So I don't think you can just go a hundred percent use these policies.
00:49:20 [W] And it will enforce your infrastructure and test it perfectly like every test. You don't always have a hundred percent coverage.
00:49:18 [W] Excellent.
00:49:19 [W] Just FYI for people who are listening to this recording or watching the recording. There will be a conversation moving forward in the new stack virtual Booth or
00:49:34 [W] Or number number for coupon mix and mingle so that's where you can see that that's in slack.
00:49:33 [W] So what are we going to another question too?
00:49:38 [W] What about AI, this is a question that came up.
00:49:41 [W] You know, what about AI to make policies for cyber security and integrated with tensor or spark or something else?
00:49:51 [W] Yeah, I mean well very hot topic, you know, and I know that you know, everybody wants it there.
00:50:04 [W] How do we enforce a no supervision there? How do we do if we want to do unsupervised?
00:50:10 [W] And how do we ensure that? We have, you know a focus data set available.
00:50:15 [W] So one of the strategies, you know that hashicorp, you know has adopted.
00:50:21 [W] As you know, they, you know had a tool called as want advisor good advice on certain policies about we need to go a little you know, Above and Beyond on that, you know front as well.
00:50:33 [W] So we need to be able to do AI for policy authoring in such a way that we should be able to scan your existing Cloud environments and then we should be able to First recommend.
00:50:45 [W] What are the you know policy that you should have and to go One Step Beyond that we should be able to
00:50:51 [W] Can your existing Cloud environments and then we should be able to First recommend?
00:50:49 [W] What are the you know policies that you should have and to go One Step Beyond that we should be able to you know codify the policies automatically as well.
00:50:58 [W] is a you know hunger for that and I think the industry is going to move towards it.
00:51:06 [W] Oh great. I want to thank you both for participating in the QA here.
00:51:11 [W] We've really enjoyed our discussion own.
00:51:16 [W] Thank you very much.
00:51:16 [W] much. It's been great to talk with you and learn more about accuracy these concepts of immutable infrastructure and immutable security and rosemary. Thank you very much for joining us.
