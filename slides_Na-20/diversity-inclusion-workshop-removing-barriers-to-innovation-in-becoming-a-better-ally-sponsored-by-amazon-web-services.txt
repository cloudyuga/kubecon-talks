00:00:00 [W] And so we become more virtual.
00:00:05 [W] In the last 10 months than we have the last 10 years.
00:00:11 [W] Oh what a time. This is.
00:00:16 [W] We've become more digital and more technically Reliant.
00:00:24 [W] More so than almost one year's time than we have ever in our times at all.
00:00:33 [W] Technology has come from a very far place and we've become more accelerated in Communications particular in the last 10 years than we have the last two preceding decades
00:00:48 [W] virtual
00:00:51 [W] in the last 10 months than we have the last 10 years.
00:00:58 [W] Oh what a time.
00:00:59 [W] This is.
00:01:03 [W] We've become more digital and more technically Reliant.
00:01:10 [W] More so than almost one years time than we have ever in our time at all.
00:01:18 [W] Technology has come from a very far place and we've become more accelerated in Communications particular in the last 10 years than we have the last
00:01:34 [W] So much has happened.
00:01:35 [W] The world has never been more politically heated with contestation and differing views and ideas.
00:01:45 [W] Didn't has today.
00:01:49 [W] So much has happened in the world.
00:01:53 [W] We've come a long way and there's been a lot of different transitions at different changes for each and every one of us things that have affected Us in ways and we certainly didn't expect coming out of 2019 here we find ourselves and
00:02:09 [W] Much more has happened at things that we have begin building and technologies that seem relevant.
00:02:16 [W] We're used to the disruption of Technology, but never have we seen a pandemic come and disrupt technology and so much has happened in the world.
00:02:26 [W] We've come a long way and so has stackrox.
00:02:39 [W] But there's more to consider.
00:02:42 [W] We see every day how advanced technology has become and what it's been to us in our daily lives and our daily dealings even here at Cube Khan in this particular conference in this event.
00:02:53 [W] We've seen what it becomes adaptation and change but I want you to consider and to take time just to consider those things but the take a little time to consider how
00:03:08 [W] Not just how you arrive the cubic on cubic on.
00:03:13 [W] Not how far you have ride to cube con to this event. But how far you arrived in your station in your particular career your vacation what you do?
00:03:24 [W] How did you get here?
00:03:28 [W] How long did it take you?
00:03:31 [W] And at what point?
00:03:33 [W] in this journey
00:03:37 [W] Somebody help you now some may say well Chris I got here all completely on my own and I arrived here by myself. And I knew what I wanted to do since day one and I just got up and I woke up and I did if that is you if you're the
00:03:52 [W] Earlier this event the perhaps this session may not be for you.
00:03:50 [W] But if you're like me and so many others that I suspect perhaps even all of us.
00:03:58 [W] At the Met at some points somehow.
00:04:02 [W] On the road that somebody help point us.
00:04:07 [W] in the right direction
00:04:11 [W] while we're thinking about that and taking an internal inventory on how such things happen.
00:04:19 [W] I would ask you to consider even further.
00:04:22 [W] A little more as to what brought you here today.
00:04:27 [W] Now in front of you, there's a box where you can submit questions and things of that nature and answers or you can keep it unto yourself, which is fine.
00:04:34 [W] You're amongst friends.
00:04:39 [W] Begin to consider what brought us here.
00:04:41 [W] What brought you and I here today?
00:04:47 [W] Why this we go to cube con to learn about technology?
00:04:51 [W] We did a q Khan to learn about open source systems Linux we go to Q conditioner and learn and to understand better about what we do as technologists artist.
00:05:06 [W] Why attend the diversity inclusion session?
00:05:09 [W] Coming a better Ally why have you attended and what brought you here today?
00:05:11 [W] It's just we come here for technology.
00:05:13 [W] Why is this such an even here? Well, I would have you to submit for everyone to consider that we talk about ecosystems because systems this and Technical ecosystems that but one thing we must understand is that ecosystems are just a set of hardware and software
00:05:29 [W] ball
00:05:26 [W] And culture isn't separate apart from technology culture is people.
00:05:32 [W] You as an individual have your own autonomy in your own culture as you abide yet in an ecosystem.
00:05:41 [W] and when we talk about culture
00:05:44 [W] We wanted to understood to be understood and to understand that the more culture that we add to ecosystems doesn't take away from the ecosystem culture that we add to our ecosystems.
00:05:56 [W] It levels up the whole ecosystem and the stronger that that ecosystem becomes.
00:06:00 [W] So what brought you here today?
00:06:09 [W] Hello.
00:06:09 [W] my name is Christopher Lafayette International and National speaker on emerging Technologies and applied sciences culture and inclusion advocate.
00:06:19 [W] in technology
00:06:22 [W] when I was a kid, I've come home and I've come to the door of the hall and look into a room and there was a man sitting at a desk with a little light on.
00:06:33 [W] Taking apart and tearing down a building up computers.
00:06:38 [W] I'd go to this man and I say Dad.
00:06:41 [W] What's the internet?
00:06:44 [W] That man would stop looking at me.
00:06:46 [W] And he would tell me about what the internet was.
00:06:49 [W] On the next day.
00:06:48 [W] I would come home and walked to the door up to Hall look into this room and this man sitting at this selfsame desk with the light on.
00:06:56 [W] And I'd ask him.
00:06:59 [W] Dad how does the web work
00:07:04 [W] That man would stop looking me.
00:07:07 [W] And tell me about how the web works and how it flowed and operated and behave.
00:07:13 [W] The little did I have appreciation. That was at that time that I was beginning to understand my first understanding and lessons on technology and down the years and up to way even after that man's
00:07:28 [W] Demise that I didn't begin to have such a depreciation as I do yet did this day on what I was given?
00:07:28 [W] Now when I came to Silicon Valley my native area home run that when I came to Silicon Valley. I came to Silicon Valley black color skin, and I found myself working with people.
00:07:40 [W] It didn't look like me and being taught by women and men and like and others.
00:07:47 [W] Technology and working with people and technology. That didn't come for places where I come from like East Oakland or Brooklyn.
00:07:55 [W] Baltimore
00:07:57 [W] South Central, LA Atlanta
00:08:02 [W] And it didn't necessarily come from where I come from nor did we share perhaps in the exact same culture?
00:08:09 [W] and at some point
00:08:11 [W] when I found myself in Silicon Valley and sleeping on a hacker spaces living in my car, but between Google and NASA Ames but attending different sessions and meetups and technology and taking all that I could end to build more with such a thirst
00:08:27 [W] Wonder if you will.
00:08:25 [W] Self same people that have been teaching me and I've been learning with side-by-side. Some of them asked me to speak at different groups and speak at different events different sessions.
00:08:36 [W] I found myself speaking across Silicon Valley from what they're speaking in the western region United States and eventually across the country and around the world. And while I'm speaking at these technology events front of audiences. Sometimes hundreds,
00:08:51 [W] Thousands began to look in the audience and it dawned on me that there weren't too many people that look like me.
00:08:42 [W] And mother sitting on stage moderating the panel or giving a keynote or a lecture.
00:08:48 [W] Stanford and Mayo Clinic and things of that nature there weren't too many people that look like me.
00:08:57 [W] And began to dawn on me that as much as we've built in technology as much as we're seeing an emergent Technologies.
00:09:07 [W] As much as we've achieved in as much as we've done.
00:09:12 [W] In the dawn I made that.
00:09:14 [W] We have to go back.
00:09:18 [W] You see with all the advances of what we are and what we had today.
00:09:24 [W] And what's been discovered if you will Embark upon we're now seeing things the technologies that were only written in novels and other people's minds perhaps you missed something yours.
00:09:37 [W] And we're seeing that being manifested before our very eyes, but we have to go back.
00:09:42 [W] There are people.
00:09:45 [W] And principles that we left behind.
00:09:51 [W] So what I did was I said what if I took all these people that I've been working with here in the valley and other places across the country and around the world. What if I took all these people
00:10:00 [W] Don't come from and I don't come from where they come up and what if I took the communities and different people that come from places where I come from and created and served and built a bridge.
00:10:10 [W] To bring them together.
00:10:11 [W] What would that look like what would happen?
00:10:16 [W] And so I did.
00:10:19 [W] But we're going to take the rest of that experience and we're going to put that over here.
00:10:24 [W] We'll come back to it.
00:10:25 [W] I promise but we have much to go on our journey with a little bit of time that we have to go together, but we'll come back to that. I promise.
00:10:35 [W] So what brought you here?
00:10:37 [W] today is courage, but
00:10:42 [W] Before there was courage.
00:10:46 [W] before we touched on Courage
00:10:49 [W] there is desire.
00:10:54 [W] Not everyone's here today.
00:10:57 [W] Well attended Cube con.
00:10:59 [W] But this wasn't just for everyone but everyone could benefit.
00:11:04 [W] But you're the different one.
00:11:07 [W] And your company and your station and your heart?
00:11:11 [W] A desire to not only want to do better but to understand what might be the void that may be latent Within.
00:11:21 [W] To achieve levels internally of which you may not have.
00:11:25 [W] Are you had the desire to do such?
00:11:21 [W] So that courage was the sword and shield never would you have picked those two off without desire?
00:11:29 [W] Your desire is fortified and filled.
00:11:33 [W] with the hope
00:11:35 [W] to become a better Ally.
00:11:39 [W] and that we find ourselves in these companies via virtual now for the most part in working on these platforms when we take a lie and ship and these are like vessels these companies these ecosystems and on a ship there are people and people do different
00:11:54 [W] different stations and operations and functions that they do on these ships and there's allies
00:11:52 [W] It is decorated throughout.
00:11:56 [W] the people that help keep the flow going
00:12:02 [W] the people that have identified especially on Tech campuses.
00:12:06 [W] tangible or virtual
00:12:09 [W] that there has to be more than a set of code and hardware and software to keep us together.
00:12:14 [W] There must be something more.
00:12:18 [W] So are given tasks and daily duty of commitments.
00:12:22 [W] When it comes to sustainability in the greater and better growth and foundational structure of where we find ourselves at and what we build in.
00:12:32 [W] So you've become an ally it just by you taking the step here today?
00:12:39 [W] whether you are an ally before a new it or whether you're a lie and never even know it but today I let you know that you're an ally and we're talking about allyship because with allyship leads us to
00:12:53 [W] community
00:12:56 [W] now in community
00:13:00 [W] each and every person that brings a different culture to this ecosystem.
00:13:06 [W] They're bringing their past and bringing their history their Heritage their expertise.
00:13:10 [W] Why you taking the step here today?
00:13:11 [W] whether you were an ally before a new it, whether you're a lie and never even know it but today I let you know that you're an ally and we're talking about allyship because without allyship leads us to
00:13:25 [W] community
00:13:28 [W] now in community
00:13:31 [W] each and every person that brings a different culture to this ecosystem.
00:13:37 [W] They're bringing their past and bringing their history their Heritage their expertise.
00:13:43 [W] They're lenses perspective the diversity of who they are what they are why they are how they've become what they contribute their bringing all of that.
00:13:56 [W] And the collective of the Allies in these ecosystems form a community.
00:14:02 [W] We have to get ask ourselves today.
00:14:04 [W] Have we done enough in our communities?
00:14:08 [W] Have I been the best person to the person next to me?
00:14:13 [W] Have I been the best helper the best keeper?
00:14:20 [W] Did I take time to remember how I got to the position where I'm at?
00:14:27 [W] the principle of helping of giving back
00:14:32 [W] of extending a hand or even simply helping point someone in the right direction and my community have I've done the best that I can.
00:14:40 [W] And my contributions and when we talk about allies yet, when we talk about Community like in a nun to go into the store for the very first time and discovering something that you like and I say wow, I'm going up and down an aisle because this is what it's like
00:14:56 [W] giving back
00:14:57 [W] of extending a hand or even simply helping point someone in the right direction and my community have I done the best that I can.
00:15:06 [W] and my contributions
00:15:09 [W] And when we talk about allies yet, when we talk about Community like in a non to going to the store for the very first time and discovering something that you like and I say wow, I'm going up and down an aisle because this is what it's like when you come into a community into a system in your
00:15:24 [W] Realize it or not your Discovery and you meet people and this case you go to Trader Joe's for some maybe Whole Foods.
00:15:31 [W] And you're going down to Island. There is a tea that I like.
00:15:35 [W] To try and you take that and you discover this to you this new thing and you take it and then you'd look at it. And once you discover it you explore it.
00:15:44 [W] Let me check the ingredients so I check. No I can't do that.
00:15:47 [W] I can't do not process on the I can't do that I can do.
00:15:51 [W] Okay, I'll do it.
00:15:52 [W] have it and you're exploring and the cupboard it goes in the consumption session comes shortly after.
00:16:00 [W] And once you're satisfied with the pellet, perhaps you're like me or so many other people you will share a mother the tea that you discovered inside Trader Joes are Whole Foods.
00:16:09 [W] So the whole world for the whole world to see that I am now become an expert and understanding this tea.
00:16:17 [W] and so Mastery comes
00:16:21 [W] that's like a nun to the ecosystems that we come involve ourselves in and to better understanding people.
00:16:30 [W] and our discovery that we've discovered that there are people that are different from us to come from different lands with different behaviors and to explore
00:16:41 [W] Who they are?
00:16:44 [W] We will never be as great and Technology.
00:16:47 [W] We will never be as advanced technology until we have a better sense of the people that build it.
00:16:55 [W] How could we ever have an appreciation for the home?
00:17:01 [W] And not the one that built it that's all I've always been taught.
00:17:07 [W] It's up to seek and to thrive for Mastery and to better understanding all the people and all the different lenses perspective and the added benefit in the value gained from having more culture.
00:17:19 [W] when we move away from a monocultural perspective
00:17:26 [W] meaning one and how we build
00:17:29 [W] and in business when we move towards a poly cultural lens and acceptance from leadership to ERG and everyone in between.
00:17:40 [W] Then we find ourselves in a situation.
00:17:42 [W] Where were able to grow.
00:17:45 [W] Well people say well Chris.
00:17:47 [W] I don't know about that.
00:17:48 [W] I mean I know when we talk about diversity inclusion of more culture in there, but but look at Apple. I mean I know apple is admitted that Apple has it, you know a dni situation.
00:17:57 [W] They're not as more culturally accepting and with other people from different backgrounds as they want, but Apple unit evaluated at 1 to 2 trillion dollar company.
00:18:05 [W] I don't know about that, but I would have you to submit.
00:18:10 [W] and even as greatest companies of Apple and Google which products we enjoy and we like so much a lot of us do some may not
00:18:17 [W] But even as great as Apple has become.
00:18:21 [W] perhaps Apple if it had more culture that a desire to have perhaps it would be valued as a 9 to 10 trillion dollar company today as opposed to a one to two trillion dollar company and perhaps we've set our standards
00:18:37 [W] So low and we haven't set them high enough for what more that we could achieve together and we talked about having that more culture integrated into these ecosystems.
00:18:50 [W] And become a master if you will a peer-to-peer communication and identify ability and acceptance.
00:18:58 [W] Perhaps then we'll understand the adage that we want to hire the people that we want to buy our products.
00:19:07 [W] that the work that you do today will be appreciated by many Aesthetics some
00:19:16 [W] So now what we're going to do is we're taking a mid section internal reflection.
00:19:23 [W] And the question that I want you to take out your notepads and submit into the question box if you will and again you can keep this onto yourself and if you have any questions, let us know.
00:19:35 [W] Once you to do is I want you to take time to consider now.
00:19:38 [W] It does mid-session internal reflection.
00:19:44 [W] What haven't you done?
00:19:48 [W] What have you achieved and we talked early on about why?
00:19:54 [W] You're here today and how far you've come and how far technology has come.
00:20:00 [W] There's still some things left.
00:20:03 [W] What haven't you done?
00:20:08 [W] I'm not talking about what you've learned and your academic studies, but what haven't you done now?
00:20:13 [W] It's not just for the workplace. It could be for your community your neighborhood.
00:20:18 [W] your family
00:20:21 [W] under the banner of allyship.
00:20:26 [W] What haven't you done yet?
00:20:30 [W] Now write that down. We take a moment to reflect and to pause and to consider when we talk about that no matter what it is.
00:20:38 [W] You don't have to share it again, or you can share it.
00:20:40 [W] What haven't you done?
00:20:45 [W] It will take a few seconds to consider that.
00:20:48 [W] Right in our notes some still use pencil and paper others use notes in your Android or your idevice.
00:20:57 [W] What haven't you done?
00:21:01 [W] Now we're taking honest inventory within to consider these things.
00:21:09 [W] What haven't we accomplished?
00:21:12 [W] What do we want to accomplish?
00:21:17 [W] So we move forward and once you've had that question or once you have that statement.
00:21:33 [W] For those that are just not joining us. What we're going to do is we're going to do a recap.
00:21:39 [W] When we start to look at how far we've come and where we've arrived.
00:21:46 [W] In fact, what we're going to do is we're going to go and do a super-fast recap.
00:21:51 [W] This is something you may not have seen done before an event.
00:21:57 [W] But you'll see it today.
00:22:06 [W] And we're waiting for the slides to come on.
00:22:12 [W] Bear with us as we have some difficulties here.
00:22:23 [W] And we are waiting.
00:22:29 [W] And still waiting for the slides to come on.
00:22:41 [W] Please bear with us.
00:22:43 [W] As we wait for our slides to come on.
00:22:48 [W] And we are still waiting for the slides to come on.
00:23:03 [W] And looking for number two to come onto that we could do our recap.
00:23:18 [W] Thank you for your patience everyone.
00:23:33 [W] And I'm still waiting for it to show up.
00:23:57 [W] And hopefully you can see where I'm at and slide to I can't tell if it's present or not, but I'll make the assumption.
00:24:07 [W] And we'll go from there as will. Do this recap that along this journey.
00:24:14 [W] We've already talked about that much has happened in this world and hopefully that you can see this slide and that much has happened in this world and its advances technology has become we talked about this and as far as we've come we've come a long way
00:24:29 [W] And that we become more virtual in the last 10 years.
00:24:33 [W] Then we have in the last 10 months.
00:24:37 [W] We've become more virtual in the last 10 months than we have in the last 10 years.
00:24:40 [W] We've become more digital in the last 10 years than two decades proceeding than that, but then we took time as our recap goes to stop and to consider for a moment.
00:24:52 [W] Not just how far in advance technology has become but to stop and consider exactly how far in advance that you all have become.
00:25:01 [W] And whatever it is, if you've done your vocation your career path and what you've done how far have you come?
00:25:08 [W] And stop to consider the magnitude of what it took to be able to get you here.
00:25:13 [W] And so yes, we continue our recap and we've taken time and our journey thus far to consider exactly how far you've come and what it took for you to get here and then we've asked the question what brought you here today?
00:25:27 [W] What brought you here?
00:25:28 [W] Not just a cubic on but to have diversity and inclusion session and a session like this that doesn't necessarily seem to have its place within technology, but we've already confessed.
00:25:38 [W] We've already discussed that when we look at ecosystem ecosystems aren't just a set of hardware and software that ecosystems are people.
00:25:49 [W] And that people our culture and Technology as culture and the more culture that we have into our ecosystem.
00:25:55 [W] The stronger that ecosystem becomes culture doesn't take away from an ecosystem culture levels up the entire ecosystem.
00:26:06 [W] And then we moved even further beyond that when we talked about what brought us here today, then we moved forward and we had that question.
00:26:13 [W] what brought me here to this room to this session of all sessions that Cube Khan has to offer of all that wonderful things and we talk about open source networks, and we talked about the advancements of code and how far we've come and how much we've been reliant on
00:26:28 [W] Communication and Technology as we move forward in this 2020 year.
00:26:34 [W] And we ask ourselves why the session of all sessions?
00:26:40 [W] And then that's what came to play The Sword and the shield of Courage.
00:26:46 [W] And I shared with many of you that hello.
00:26:48 [W] My name is Christopher Lafayette International and National speaker on emerging Technologies.
00:26:54 [W] And that when I was a kid, I would come home and walk through this room and walk up the hall and into the doorway and I look and there's a man sitting at a desk with a little light on and the chair taking apart and building up computers and I would say to this man dad.
00:27:09 [W] What is the internet that man would stop look at me and tell me what the internet was?
00:27:16 [W] You would tell me about it on the next day.
00:27:18 [W] I'd walk through that selfsame door up the hall and looking into the room and the man sitting at that desk with a little light on tearing apart and putting them back together computers again, and I say Dad.
00:27:29 [W] How does the web work and man would go about to tell me about how the web works and I found myself coming to Silicon Valley years down the road not preciate it that where I come from an environment in neighborhoods where I come from there weren't too many parents
00:27:44 [W] All that look like me that were in technology and in even some neighborhoods whether it's East Oakland Brooklyn Compton Baltimore Atlanta there weren't too many neighborhoods that had dads.
00:27:58 [W] And I came to Silicon Valley with black color skin finding myself being taught and trained by people.
00:28:04 [W] That didn't look like me that don't come from places where I come from.
00:28:08 [W] And I found myself with a incredible thirst to understand technology and to build on emerging Technologies while living out of my car between Google and NASA with the rest of the other hacker communities and people doing what they can hacking away
00:28:24 [W] building at a cars garages sleeping on sofa is another people sofas and people began to ask me to speak around and across Silicon Valley and around the west coast and across the United States and eventually around the world where I found myself and I was staring
00:28:38 [W] Looking at audiences and finding out there weren't too many people whether hundreds or thousands in attendance that look like me.
00:28:46 [W] And our recap we talked about this and when I was on stage, I'd look to my left and right and there weren't too many people that look like me.
00:28:54 [W] And I said to myself what would happen if I took all these people that I've been working with and building and exploring with what would happen if I took them and brought them and paired them with people that come from environments and where I come from and brought them together and served as a bridge.
00:29:08 [W] What would that look like?
00:29:09 [W] What would that be? Like what would happen now? We're going to take that and as I promised we would come back to that and we're doing a brief recap for those that have come in late and those that are still yet with us to be able to serve to better understand why we are here today because of courage.
00:29:24 [W] The sword and shield but before there was courage.
00:29:32 [W] before we had courage
00:29:36 [W] there's desire and we talked about that.
00:29:39 [W] We knew that there was more for us showing up in this event today with all the things that we could be doing, especially in attendance at Cube con or in our daily lives with all the obstacles in the virtual obstacles that we find ourselves in.
00:29:54 [W] So that we could be doing we showed up here not because of Courage that's just a sword and shield but because of desire and the desire to do what and to be why the desire to be a better Ally that understanding that our ecosystems are the ship.
00:30:10 [W] in the allyship, and that the Ally is you and I
00:30:17 [W] and that in the ship of allyship and in these ecosystems in these communities, they're our allies there in and allies throughout and there are those that have showed up today that may not have known and understood that they are an ally but I'm here
00:30:32 [W] Tell you today that you are an ally at this point put in any questions that you have in a little box ahead of you.
00:30:39 [W] any questions that you may have but today whether you've been conscious of it or not or realize you're an ally you showed up when the rest haven't and so we're recapping we're bringing everyone up to us to where we're going, but we
00:30:54 [W] Much more to ground to cover and we have a little bit of time to get there and here we are yet in communities and we're figuring out to ourselves.
00:31:02 [W] How do I become the better Ally?
00:31:03 [W] What are the barriers that I face and becoming the better Allied that I can be?
00:31:08 [W] What are the barriers that me as a company whether I'm on leadership ERG and everywhere in between what are the barriers that I faced to grow and skill my platform my start up my Corporation. What are the barriers that I
00:31:23 [W] face to see
00:31:27 [W] And the first thing that brings us his Discovery we talked about this were walking and Trader Joe's and Whole Foods and we walk down our favorite aisles and all of a sudden we see that brand new Rooibos spiced pumpkin tea latte T that we never had that chili teeth in and we take
00:31:42 [W] It and we're discovering and from Discovery we take that and we look at the back of it.
00:31:47 [W] Can I even drink this?
00:31:49 [W] No soy, no nuts.
00:31:50 [W] It's going on the same platform as where they building.
00:31:53 [W] Okay, I can take the okay. I can take this I buy it I bring it.
00:31:58 [W] It's in the cupboard and then one day I consume it.
00:32:03 [W] And from there comes Mastery because I'm sharing it on my Instagram and my Facebook and perhaps maybe even my LinkedIn on a story on a tweet.
00:32:11 [W] I'm sharing that I now have to tell you about this tea that I had in your sharing it with everyone else and the same joy that you get from discovering and exploring and mastering the taste of that t is this
00:32:27 [W] Seeing feeling that we want to have and that I promise you will have from allyship.
00:32:34 [W] You'll want to tell everyone about it not because it's the envelope thing to do or that it takes the courage or that it may be popular.
00:32:43 [W] But from the results of what you see from True allyship gives you such a feeling that you can't help but tell people about it.
00:32:53 [W] And so we move on during our recap and we look at this and now we head into our mid-session internal reflection where I ask you all to write a note and submit a question and you can share it with all of us.
00:33:08 [W] And the question that we have to ask ourselves is what haven't I done?
00:33:13 [W] To become a better Ally in my community and my company and my platform external to others from other people that don't look like me and other neighborhoods.
00:33:22 [W] What haven't I done I want you to take 30 seconds will give you the 30 seconds and I want you to take that write it in this box or keep it unto yourself. You're amongst friends.
00:33:33 [W] They won't judge you and it's okay if you want to keep that to yourself close to your heart.
00:33:40 [W] The question was asked what haven't I done what more could I do?
00:33:47 [W] And while you're find yourselves coming up with the answers and perhaps a myriad of things are coming up and perhaps even not and that's okay.
00:33:55 [W] But I believe that it's the latter that things are coming up and we ask ourselves what haven't I done and now that we have those on the table in our notes on our pen and paper and Pad Where Do We Begin?
00:34:09 [W] And I'm often asked Chris.
00:34:10 [W] Where do I begin when it comes to technology?
00:34:12 [W] How do I become a better Ally?
00:34:15 [W] What do I do?
00:34:16 [W] What's the better way to go?
00:34:17 [W] What is an ally?
00:34:18 [W] I understand?
00:34:19 [W] it's a ship and that I'm just person that's on it that's supporting whatever system that I find myself in to be a better citizen of this allyship of this community. But where do I begin and I tell you right now that where you begin is with self.
00:34:36 [W] And that removing barriers to innovation.
00:34:41 [W] removing barriers to innovation
00:34:45 [W] as self and that the biggest barrier to removing
00:34:54 [W] is you
00:34:59 [W] You are the biggest barrier to innovation.
00:35:04 [W] Are self-limiting beliefs our doubts that we can't do it.
00:35:09 [W] our lack of vulnerability
00:35:12 [W] everybody says that's the new word in town.
00:35:15 [W] Its vulnerability.
00:35:16 [W] You must be vulnerable and you must know what is vulnerable vulnerability comes down and pulls it down, too.
00:35:24 [W] listening
00:35:26 [W] Understanding even with what?
00:35:30 [W] I think that I dunno of the person that's in front of me. They may look like me. They may even have the same color as good.
00:35:35 [W] I am not them.
00:35:37 [W] They have a different culture a different lens and the best thing that I could do as I was always taught two ears one mouth for me to listen more than I talked to listen to consider a thing of which they're saying to us because so many people in this very politicized world were passions
00:35:52 [W] Ever been higher the debate has never been more higher off the screen the Richter scale and everybody wants to say something and everyone's talking but who is listening?
00:36:02 [W] And this time we asked it to take time to listen.
00:36:07 [W] And before we have vulnerability there has to be open-mindedness.
00:36:14 [W] and being open-minded
00:36:18 [W] to even consider that maybe perhaps there is a better way.
00:36:22 [W] Yes, there could be several ways to a destination in my destination doesn't always have to be that way perhaps someone else's destination maybe better perhaps someone else's hurt needs to be listened to perhaps.
00:36:36 [W] Me considering that we have to go back and get the things that we left behind.
00:36:42 [W] Including our principles that at one point at sometimes somebody pointed Us in the right direction.
00:36:52 [W] To get to where we're at.
00:36:53 [W] We talked about that we talked about.
00:36:55 [W] How did you get here?
00:36:56 [W] How did you arrive but at some point we must consider?
00:37:01 [W] When we're answering the question within our own hearts and minds of how we got here.
00:37:05 [W] We have to consider.
00:37:07 [W] How did we get here? And at what point who help point us in the right direction and showed us the way
00:37:17 [W] And then once we have an open mind in this to understand that there's more that we don't know.
00:37:22 [W] And taking on the disposition of vulnerability to sitting with those.
00:37:29 [W] That have something to share in this set and for us to want to understand their better and the better understand their lenses perspective that will make us a better colleague that will make us a better neighbor that will make us a better overall person and how we go about doing and dealing in our daily lives
00:37:44 [W] In this world has become more virtual than it's ever been.
00:37:46 [W] We cannot say that we've been come so Advanced and so great in technology if we haven't added appreciation for those that have built it.
00:37:55 [W] We will never be as advanced as we can.
00:38:00 [W] With anything that we could hack build a make.
00:38:06 [W] Until we have a better appreciation for those that build it.
00:38:12 [W] An ecosystem is not a set of code hardware and software ecosystems are people.
00:38:18 [W] And the more culture that we have in the better cultural understanding that better will be become.
00:38:23 [W] Well Chris.
00:38:23 [W] that's a good argument.
00:38:24 [W] But as I said before Apple says they're about value.
00:38:27 [W] That's a one to two trillion dollar company Apple is they're valued as a one to two trillion dollar company, and I know that they said they have a culture problem in a dni problem a we care for Apple. We appreciate those that build Apple products, but even Apple the great Apple
00:38:42 [W] Have you checked the time to stop be considered that perhaps album could be valued as a 9 to 10 trillion dollar company.
00:38:50 [W] Had it taken in more culture like it once as opposed to a one to two trillion dollar company and perhaps we have set our standards lower.
00:39:00 [W] Then what we should have and perhaps it's much higher.
00:39:05 [W] Then it should be.
00:39:10 [W] Now as I continue to take time to write notes or whatever questions and to remove barriers to Innovation, but then there's the willingness that has to happen because we can have an open mind and we can have a vulnerability disposition, but there has to be the Wilderness inside.
00:39:26 [W] And that willingness inside there has to be more than just that because when we had that willingness inside, but then we say, I know Chris.
00:39:33 [W] I know I need to do better.
00:39:34 [W] I know that I could do better.
00:39:36 [W] I know I wanted to better else. Why would I be here at an event like this of all places that Cube Khan where we're talking about diversity and inclusion in the middle of the code and the middle of the open source here. We are talking about this subject.
00:39:49 [W] But I don't know if I could do it and that's where doubt comes in.
00:39:54 [W] One of the biggest enemies in my understanding that we've come to face when it comes to self and us is dealt.
00:40:01 [W] And look no one's asking you to take the ball all the way a hundred yards of other side of the field.
00:40:06 [W] No one's asking you to do that.
00:40:08 [W] No one's wanting you to do that.
00:40:12 [W] the first step
00:40:14 [W] the first step is what we're wanting. The first step is what helps get us there.
00:40:23 [W] And when we were there and we find ourselves in a situation where we took the first step.
00:40:28 [W] Then and only then are we effectively being able to understand the value when you took time to listen to someone when you tell time to exercise their perspective and of coorporate that in your daily lives and then you gave back.
00:40:44 [W] When you did that then we begin to understand what servant leadership is.
00:40:52 [W] As a servant leader, it's about not just serving others and giving back and doing these things but servant leadership is serving yourself.
00:41:01 [W] impart
00:41:05 [W] to understand that there are different people in this world whom we've never even met they come from different backgrounds and walks of life. And if we just took that time to better understand
00:41:18 [W] the quell my desire to want to be able to speak to want to be able to say
00:41:24 [W] but to listen if we did that installed the reflection that you got back from that person through your servant leadership to be able to intake their considerations.
00:41:36 [W] how much fruitful and rewarding it would become now we said to ourselves but how
00:41:44 [W] how do I become a servant leader?
00:41:46 [W] How do I become more vulnerable?
00:41:47 [W] How do I show this?
00:41:49 [W] How do I manifested?
00:41:50 [W] How do I become the change?
00:41:52 [W] How do I stop talking?
00:41:54 [W] How do I start doing more?
00:41:56 [W] How do I go about living this life and doing this and demonstrating this daily?
00:42:06 [W] It's real simple. It's becoming actionable.
00:42:15 [W] I hope that there's such a time in life the five to 10 years from now.
00:42:21 [W] That will never have to have a need for these type of discussions and conversations on diversity inclusion and equity and belonging and the better understand it ecosystems are people and not just a set of software and Hardware that ecosystems are people and culture and
00:42:37 [W] Culture that we have the stronger our culture and our ecosystem becomes the better identifiable our products become.
00:42:44 [W] The Wider our district and distribution channels become and that we fulfilled in live to the adage that we want to hire the people that we want to buy our products.
00:42:57 [W] And so I went and I said what if I take these people that don't come from places where I come from and pair them with people with places where I do come from what happens if I bring them together and serve as a bridge, what will that look like?
00:43:12 [W] What would that be like?
00:43:15 [W] And from there I created with my little bit of allyship capability a platform called the black Technology mentorship Program.
00:43:26 [W] And we took people and we've taken people from all different backgrounds and walks of life all different professionals from companies where you work at now and from somewhere you don't and places you've never even heard of companies you very much have heard and from companies and corporations when new Partnerships
00:43:41 [W] relationships and we've taken all of these people from different backgrounds and ecosystems and we've taken them and we brought them together and I say to you and I submit to you that that is what we are asking ourselves
00:43:56 [W] And we asked ourselves what more can we do and it is simple because the thing that we must understand is that we did not get to where we're at on our own.
00:44:08 [W] And at some point somebody help lead you and give you the way.
00:44:14 [W] Through servant leadership in the willingness of your heart to give back.
00:44:21 [W] the impact of mentorship
00:44:25 [W] not just with my program with black technology mentorship program, but programs that may be near and dear to you programs that may get him not then.
00:44:34 [W] discovered and built and shown with Mastery to the world
00:44:39 [W] mentorship. It could just be your colleague.
00:44:44 [W] Or she or he just began their job and their career and you've been well on your way for some time.
00:44:51 [W] To ask them your neighbor.
00:44:54 [W] Hey, are you okay?
00:44:57 [W] How can I help is there something that I can do?
00:45:04 [W] Those such the value of Simply pointing someone in the right direction.
00:45:08 [W] Oh the potency.
00:45:11 [W] Oh the care that comes with simply helping point someone in the right direction.
00:45:16 [W] Can you imagine what you would be and where you would be in your life? If somebody didn't take the time the point you and I and the right direction.
00:45:29 [W] guidance
00:45:32 [W] from our young ones to our senior
00:45:37 [W] no matter the color.
00:45:39 [W] No matter the gender no matter the culture no matter the age no matter the person we all are in need of guidance.
00:45:51 [W] What more could I do what more can I do?
00:45:57 [W] When it comes to serving.
00:45:59 [W] When it comes to adding more and giving back to others when we talk about that in a world where everyone gets to build not just a few.
00:46:10 [W] because if we all don't find ourselves building out technology and contributing that if we don't stop right now this moment to go back to get the ones that we left behind as great as our technology has become
00:46:25 [W] And as great as our technology can be in the time of emergent technical growth.
00:46:33 [W] Our technology will never be as great in his unique as it possibly could the things that you were going to go to work on on Monday will never be as great as it can be.
00:46:46 [W] the things that you worked on yesterday will never be as great as they can be unless
00:46:53 [W] we all have an opportunity to build it together.
00:46:58 [W] And when we're building together, and we're on that track.
00:47:03 [W] And we're reaching out to those that come from different areas in different places. When I reached out to these hidden Geniuses and I shared them things that seem so irrelevant and so obsolete when they ask me all these questions and I had answers for
00:47:18 [W] them and then one day
00:47:23 [W] when they reply to me
00:47:26 [W] a thing that I shared with them and taught them that I showed them because someone else gave it to me people that don't look like me many of you are intended to probably the ones that come from different cultures of the type of people that have helped teach me and part.
00:47:43 [W] How can I keep the things that you've given to me and not give it to others?
00:47:50 [W] When I'm talking to one of our hidden Geniuses Crumb from these Faraway communities that are about us everyday.
00:47:58 [W] And they simply reply with something that they learn by what they've been taught.
00:48:06 [W] You'll look at them.
00:48:09 [W] with different eyes
00:48:12 [W] and a different heart all together.
00:48:15 [W] And you'll realize that the time was well spent.
00:48:18 [W] That what you give in.
00:48:22 [W] Is invaluable in that what you've been given?
00:48:28 [W] is priceless
00:48:31 [W] and then
00:48:33 [W] it's all that comes with that.
00:48:36 [W] You will find yourself in the situation.
00:48:40 [W] like many others
00:48:44 [W] you're a hidden hero.
00:48:49 [W] And now you've become a better Ally.
00:48:54 [W] And then that consideration removing barriers to Innovation is one less obstacle yet one step further.
00:49:07 [W] To creating the best absolute technology and experiences we can and we didn't start with code and algorithms.
00:49:17 [W] We started from the heart.
00:49:22 [W] And then we find ourselves Building Together.
00:49:26 [W] Thank you everyone.
00:49:28 [W] Thank you for your time.
00:49:29 [W] Thank you for your commitment.
00:49:31 [W] Thank you for your trust.
00:49:33 [W] Thank you for taking the journey with me.
00:49:36 [W] I'm here if any of you need me.
00:49:37 [W] we'll take some time for questions, but I want you to know that you can always get in contact with me.
00:49:41 [W] Find me on LinkedIn.
00:49:42 [W] Find me on the web.
00:49:43 [W] Send me a pigeon a scroll.
00:49:47 [W] Thank you for taking the time to be able to spend with us and to build together.
00:49:53 [W] My name is Christopher Lafayette and it's been such a pleasure in this very virtual world. And I hope that all of you will keep well and that you hold well, and your family is in you will be safe.
00:50:05 [W] And that you've got something out of what was said today?
00:50:09 [W] Now move on to QA if you have any questions feel free to cement at this time.
00:50:17 [W] And I'm taking a look at what we have.
00:50:25 [W] We have quite a few.
00:50:30 [W] Gem, I hope that you were here and that you're able to see it.
00:50:33 [W] I know they may have had a few technical issues.
00:50:35 [W] But we hope that it was fixed.
00:50:37 [W] This was recorded live or spoken or given live.
00:50:40 [W] Hopefully we will be able to provide you with a recording or a recap of what was said and I'm glad that you take time to come and visit.
00:50:50 [W] Rosaria it's such a pleasure to have you here with us.
00:50:56 [W] And it's a pleasure for us to be able to have you have a 10 here not just at this session, but it Q Khan as well and thank you for your willingness for Sherman leadership and to understand and to have a better understanding that there's more that we all can progress in and that we can learn in together.
00:51:15 [W] And so it's much appreciated and I have a question from Christian.
00:51:22 [W] Person asks, how do you break past discomfort to open the door to conversations with someone who doesn't look like you?
00:51:32 [W] I think that's a very impassioned question Chris and I have a dance that you would consider.
00:51:39 [W] Lesson that we can learn in together.
00:51:44 [W] And so it's much appreciated and I have a question from Christian Christian asks, how do you break past discomfort to open the door to conversations with someone who doesn't
00:52:40 [W] Don't look like us.
00:52:44 [W] Is to empathize and understand that first you're talking to somebody that's maybe not a manager or maybe not just a colleague but you're talking to another human being and they certainly sometimes are equipped with their own implicit and explicit biases.
00:52:59 [W] A lot with us, even I am guilty of this.
00:53:02 [W] I'd be a liar if I said that I wasn't but we have it but to understand that people are approachable. But to really consider that we often talk about foreign languages when I fly to Italy or France or
00:53:17 [W] All but to really consider that we often talk about foreign languages when I fly to Italy or France or the UK or maybe not the UK but to other places Southeast Asia or Asia and I go to different places there are different languages, but I want
00:53:30 [W] These days or Asia and I go to different places there are different languages, but I want you to consider Christian and for all of you that are in attendance.
00:53:37 [W] We want you to consider that consider that people.
00:53:42 [W] our languages
00:53:45 [W] and just because someone may be speaking English or Farsi or to Golic or they're speaking.
00:53:53 [W] Italian or France just because they're speaking in a different language.
00:53:58 [W] Or even if they're speaking in the same language does it mean that you understand them?
00:54:05 [W] so the first barrier is to have a vulnerability and the open-minded that we talked about and to be able to have empathy to understand where they may come from because when you do have that conversation and you're able to go past that
00:54:20 [W] Those barriers you might find and that conversation that you're having with them.
00:54:25 [W] That the words are exchanged, but the translation may not be lining up.
00:54:31 [W] But to understand that in order to these days have a conversation that's productive.
00:54:36 [W] It is of the hope that both people have an understanding that the two people are coming from two different places at different perspectives and to be able to approach one another would have to understand for the most part that you're coming from different lives.
00:54:51 [W] Understanding that the two people are coming from two different places at different perspectives and to be able to approach one. Another would have to understand for the most part that you're coming from different lives.
00:54:52 [W] different lenses
00:54:55 [W] and so when you approach that conversation Christian with the courage and the desire understand that they have the different lens perspective and you know what? That's okay.
00:55:06 [W] That's all right to be able to do that.
00:55:08 [W] And so the discomfort you may feel and the apprehension is because you don't know how they made judge you based on what they don't know but go in there with courage with as much diplomacy as you can muster, but have the courage
00:55:23 [W] Ra courage with as much diplomacy as you can muster but have the courage to be able to show them who you are with care and kindness and consideration and even more importantly to come to the conversation if you're going to talk.
00:55:38 [W] Listening then you did talking.
00:55:40 [W] I think you may find some benefit in that take your question for your question tempora Lane.
00:55:47 [W] We have a question from town.
00:55:49 [W] How do I give myself permission to ignore my Management schedule and instead spend my time on inclusion to do the right thing.
00:56:00 [W] Well, that's a very interesting approach and a very interesting question.
00:56:06 [W] Well, what we'd never want to do is find ourselves in the workplace entering into a battle of fisticuffs.
00:56:12 [W] Certainly.
00:56:12 [W] We were hired to be able to do a job and to do the thing that we've been hired and asked of us to do should be our first priority commitment does hold sway an advantage over the station yet at the same time.
00:56:24 [W] A lot of it is about having a conversation with your management.
00:56:28 [W] Good management.
00:56:30 [W] healthy management will allow in this human Centric world that we find ourselves in.
00:56:36 [W] him and centered design communication peer-to-peer will allow you to find time to be able to speak with one another or one unto another for you to be able to share to them priorities and things that you may want to contribute when it comes to inclusion
00:56:51 [W] Longing and to approach them not just with ideas that are aloof and wild but with firm solution that you think may be the better approach.
00:56:59 [W] That means you have to do a little bit of ground work on your part.
00:57:02 [W] That means you have to be prepared to speak with your management and to have the same selfsame open understanding with great empathy that you're willing and ready to have a conversation with them, but you're ready to listen to their perspective given their tasks and Duty and job
00:57:17 [W] Well, and at the same time that you've approached this meaning with documented material to be able to express it them so that they can better understand and chew on what it is that you express to them and that you've given them on what you would like to do to be a better
00:57:25 [W] Is that you express to them and that you've given them on what you would like to do to be a better?
00:57:29 [W] Community member
00:57:31 [W] within your platform
00:57:34 [W] And in so doing that you'll find yourself in a situation where you'll have more Heroes and more support in you. Your own self will be a hero and most liked and let me share this with everyone here that when you find yourself.
00:57:49 [W] in a situation in a company where you may be the only Ally in your whole entire community that you can identify as
00:57:58 [W] you will be alone.
00:58:02 [W] You might be a pioneer.
00:58:05 [W] You may have to go the extra distance to do what others haven't done or what others may not know how to do you may be alone now outside of that ecosystem outside at that Community.
00:58:18 [W] There's plenty of people that you can reach out to I know a bunch I get good information and get a good advice from so many other people I give it to thousands of people often I feel
00:58:29 [W] But you're not alone in your community.
00:58:32 [W] You may be but in your community.
00:58:33 [W] you're a Pioneer Sacagawea Lewis and Clark Ponce de Leon.
00:58:37 [W] You may have to play the role of the Explorer discover and the person that brings Mastery for excellence to your platform and why not?
00:58:49 [W] Because if not you then who there are people that are relying on what you do inside that company that have never set foot inside your company for one day.
00:59:05 [W] find a laptop behind the screen learning and educating themselves to one day Ingress hopefully into the same platform that your end or in the same Community environment that your n
00:59:16 [W] and they're going to need you.
00:59:19 [W] Every good Community every ecosystem needs its Heroes.
00:59:24 [W] And now that we've identified that you're an ally there's no exception.
00:59:32 [W] We've got time for another question.
00:59:39 [W] The most diverse Community there is an open-source kubernative we have work to do.
00:59:46 [W] And that's right.
00:59:47 [W] I agree with that.
00:59:49 [W] We all have work to do.
00:59:52 [W] You can do it alone. You're not going to achieve it alone.
00:59:57 [W] We have to do it together with a willing heart determination.
01:00:03 [W] Not be hindered by our own self limiting beliefs that says we can not sell ourselves.
01:00:09 [W] We become better at selling ourselves on why we can't do a thing as opposed to selling ourselves on while we can
01:00:17 [W] But my goodness stop for a moment. Look around you.
01:00:21 [W] In to get back if there was ever a time that you were going to do this.
01:00:18 [W] I can't find a better time and all the time that I've been here to do it.
01:00:26 [W] And you are not alone.
