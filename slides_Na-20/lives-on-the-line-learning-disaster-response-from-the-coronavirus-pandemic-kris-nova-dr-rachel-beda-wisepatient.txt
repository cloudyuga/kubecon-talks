00:00:00 [W] Hello and welcome.
00:00:01 [W] I am your host Chris nóva and I am here with my good friend.
00:00:05 [W] Dr. Rachel Vita and we're going to be doing our presentation today for you.
00:00:12 [W] Covid medicine the medical industry and how that corresponds to disaster recovery and site reliability engineering and security and cloudevents knowledge.
00:00:24 [W] He's so to kick us off.
00:00:25 [W] I'll hand it over to to I'm going to call you Rachel.
00:00:29 [W] I hope that's okay.
00:00:29 [W] Yeah, great totally.
00:00:31 [W] So without further Ado my good friend, Rachel.
00:00:34 [W] /dr.
00:00:35 [W] Betta.
00:00:35 [W] Alright. Hello everyone.
00:00:37 [W] I'm dr. Rachel betta I'm an internal medicine physician trained at University of Washington.
00:00:41 [W] And I am not kubernative informed.
00:00:45 [W] I am merely kubernative adjacent.
00:00:46 [W] Thanks to my spouse Joe BEDA.
00:00:48 [W] That's how I met the lovely Chris nóva and this picture you're looking at here is one of the places I have been the most scared in my entire life.
00:00:58 [W] It's the Roman wall below the summit of Mount Baker and Chris coaxed me up like the mama bear that she is so that I can get to the summit and not die. So today I am excited to talk to you about my medicine perspective on the
00:01:11 [W] Covid-19 pandemic and how it relates to computer security.
00:01:17 [W] Well, Chris will take that part.
00:01:19 [W] I am going to tell you that part also and hi everyone again, I'm Chris nóva.
00:01:26 [W] According this I like to climb mountains, and I'm pumped to be talking about medicine and mountain climbing and computer science and security and site reliability engineering today.
00:01:26 [W] So welcome to our presentation.
00:01:31 [W] So to kick us off, I'll kind of give an overview of what we're going to be talking about and Rachel and I'll kind of go back and forth a little bit and I guess kind of just to give a little bit of context as I was going through the quarantine
00:01:46 [W] A little bit of context as I was going through the quarantine Rachel who's also my doctor and I were texting a lot because naturally as everything was happening. Every time I coughed I was like, oh gosh better text my doctor because I'm sick
00:02:01 [W] Better text me doctor because I'm sick.
00:02:03 [W] And as I started going through a lot of life in 2020 and existing independent make I started to think about how a lot of things that I was texting Rachel about were very similar to the same things.
00:02:15 [W] I do in my day job, which is site reliability engineering computer science and can software security and distributed systems as I we started to explore this more and more together we discovered there was a lot of similarity between the two and as a way to teach folks about
00:02:30 [W] out both the pandemic and computer science.
00:02:34 [W] And what would otherwise be a pretty scary realm of things?
00:02:36 [W] We're going to be drawing some parallels between the two of these and how they're similar and how they're different.
00:02:42 [W] So what we have together today for you is we have four main categories that I think we're going to kind of talk through and we'll elaborate in each one of these as we go and we've broken each of these four main categories down into just smaller sub categories.
00:02:58 [W] We're going to go over we're going to kind of take a breath first Approach at describing. This will talk about the outbreak what that meant. And in this analogy the outbreak is going to be some sort of technical event, you know, something happened that we weren't expecting whether it's a computer system being infected with a virus
00:03:13 [W] Some sort of catastrophic production outage, we'll talk about the alarm and what that looks like in the warning signs associated with that.
00:03:13 [W] We're going to talk about the the response.
00:03:16 [W] How does one respond to these types of things?
00:03:17 [W] What was it like for for Rachel as a doctor? And what is it like for you and your your Cloud native Cloud native system talk about the importance of quarantine what that means from a viral perspective and what that means in the the name of kubernative.
00:03:30 [W] We talk about information sharing and probably more important Miss information sharing.
00:03:36 [W] Further we we evaluate our response. We talk about two concepts that are both important and security prevention and detection which are equally as important in the medical field and then we're going to go into finally the future what what is coming next in the world. And and
00:03:51 [W] Me and how would we potentially recover a system from some sort of catastrophic out outage that we'll be exploring in this talk and the whole point of this talk?
00:04:00 [W] I think is to be high level kind of a 101 introductory to these lower level computer science terms in to present them in a familiar and fun way for folks at home.
00:04:11 [W] Cool. So let's let's jump right into it and I'm going to kind of be picking on Rachel here and interviewing her and asking the hard questions and she'll be able to help us out here a little bit.
00:04:21 [W] So let's let's start off.
00:04:24 [W] We have we have the outbreak. It happened.
00:04:26 [W] There's some sort of incident and let's kind of walk through what this was like for you as as a doctor and and your based out of Seattle, right Rachel.
00:04:36 [W] Yes.
00:04:37 [W] I have a I have a medicine clinic on Capitol Hill in Seattle and that's kind of weird.
00:04:40 [W] Like that everything started here in the United States.
00:04:43 [W] Yeah, so we started hearing about a new infectious disease in the Wu Han region of China.
00:04:51 [W] It was just after the new year.
00:04:54 [W] We started hearing that it was incredibly contagious in that you could spread it before you even had symptoms which is different from from the first go-around of SARS.
00:05:04 [W] It seemed to have a higher death rate than a typical respiratory virus and then
00:05:10 [W] in a couple of weeks after we started to understand a little bit more about it.
00:05:15 [W] And that's kind of weird like that everything started here in the United States.
00:05:12 [W] Yeah, so we started hearing about a new infectious disease in the Wu Han region of China.
00:05:20 [W] It was just after the New Year.
00:05:24 [W] We started hearing that it was incredibly contagious in that you could spread it before you even had symptoms which is different from from the first go-around of SARS.
00:05:32 [W] It seemed to have a higher death rate than a typical respiratory virus.
00:05:38 [W] And then a couple of weeks after we started to understand a little bit more about it.
00:05:43 [W] There was actually a big holiday in China Chinese New Year where families typically get together and travel and that was sort of the Catalyst for a lot more spread very quickly.
00:05:53 [W] So we started to hear about this in Seattle, you know, of course, it's tempting to be isolationist and think well that's not here that won't affect me.
00:06:01 [W] But of course, everything is global everyone travels all the time.
00:06:04 [W] It was pretty naive to think that something that's contagious was not
00:06:08 [W] In to affect us interesting.
00:06:10 [W] Do you remember where you were the first time you even heard the word covid?
00:06:14 [W] I mean, you know, I was probably scrolling Twitter, but we started to talk about it in the clinic and my practice partner and I wanted to be proactive about this like, you know, okay patients are going to call us we have we have
00:06:29 [W] Going to affect us interesting.
00:06:31 [W] Do you remember where you were the first time you even heard the word covid?
00:06:35 [W] I mean, you know, I was probably scrolling Twitter, but we started to talk about it in the clinic and my practice partner and I wanted to be pretty proactive about this like, you know, okay patients are going to call us we have we have
00:06:51 [W] A travel a lot.
00:06:51 [W] They're going to be calling a so what is going to be our response?
00:06:53 [W] What do we need to do in our Clinic?
00:06:55 [W] Do we need to worry about it being brought into our clinics?
00:06:57 [W] We started having these conversations pretty early on and I remember one of our employees at the time was going to travel for the February school break to a bunch of different Asian countries, and we ask that employee if when
00:07:12 [W] Mind working from home for 10 to 12 days to self quarantine and that was really controversial at the time.
00:07:17 [W] We had a lot of internal strife with this decision. But I remember really early on thinking like this is probably going to affect us. We should probably be more conservative about taking this seriously.
00:07:27 [W] So I remember having those conversations very early in 2020.
00:07:33 [W] Awesome.
00:07:34 [W] Awesome.
00:07:34 [W] Awesome. Awesome.
00:07:34 [W] So the parallel that we're going to draw here is we're going to start looking at what that would feel like
00:07:41 [W] as it relates to some sort of Club knative system. So so in this world when I say cloud native, I mean some sort of computer system running kubernative with a handful of applications running on top of it. Those applications can be used
00:07:56 [W] I meant your system or those applications can be used for for you and your business whether you're you're running a front in e-commerce website, perhaps you're running a doctor's office with the Health Portal any any sort of user level application running on top of some some underlying.
00:08:08 [W] And we're going to talk about what he would look like to start to have the same type of experience of starting to notice. Something goes wrong in your system whether in Rachel's case, she was reading on Twitter and in our case, we would probably start to see some sort of
00:08:16 [W] Up in some other systems.
00:08:18 [W] So this is a good a good opportunity to share the lesson of observability and what we mean when we say observability is your ability to understand what's happening at the system layer and more importantly to connect all of the different components of the system together.
00:08:33 [W] Other words in this example, we have a physical we have system and we have applications starting from the bottom up and in the physical part of our system.
00:08:39 [W] These are things like compute storage and network.
00:08:41 [W] This is the the Linux layer the physical layer something you could go and touch and really what kubernative does is it does a good job at orchestrating this physical layer for us and so observability would be our ability to be able to detect when something in that layer of the
00:08:56 [W] Wrong. So this is where we get into tools like Prometheus and later.
00:08:54 [W] We're going to get into more advanced runtime security tools like Falco we move into the system and that's going to be and everything from Colonel tracing to operating system logs to operating system introspection and we're going to be able to start to map those together and that's where we get into these high cardinality.
00:09:10 [W] Is that you see around the ecosystem and last but not least we have application instrumentation, which is a fancy way of saying glorified logs in my mind.
00:09:15 [W] You're actually putting lines of code into your application that can then be scooped up with tools like Prometheus such that you and your team can know about it.
00:09:23 [W] So once you have this observability system in place, what does that actually going to look like for you the first time you see something like a pandemic breaking out in a computer system. It's probably just going to look like a little blip in a graph and that little blip
00:09:36 [W] it might be something like perhaps one of your pods in your kubernative cluster ran out of memory or perhaps we started to detect system calls being executed that have never been executed before with Falco.
00:09:46 [W] And as you start to observe these hence the term observability you're going to start to have the initial warning signs of what could potentially be an outage or some sort of threat moving Downstream.
00:09:56 [W] So this is a good opportunity to enforce the fact that you want to have some system of observability in place. So when something like this starts happening you and your team are going to be able to respond.
00:10:06 [W] later
00:10:10 [W] So let's talk about the alarm.
00:10:11 [W] This is this is the exciting one.
00:10:14 [W] This is like where the rubber meets the road when something happens.
00:10:18 [W] So what was it?
00:10:19 [W] What was it like for you for you in Seattle when all of a sudden like the alarm got sounded?
00:10:24 [W] Yeah. I heard I heard reports that there were two people that had coronavirus in Washington state. We were pretty much the very first hotspot.
00:10:34 [W] Probably the first and there were two cases. They were both in the county north of here Snohomish County. So, of course you're like, well, that's not my accounting.
00:10:39 [W] It's not going to affect me and you know, you try to reassure yourself while these people had actually come back from China they were traveling, you know, so clearly it's not spreading from person to person who Washington like it's still going to be okay, you know, there's all this rationalization everybody tries to do
00:10:54 [W] Had nursing home cases at Life Care Center in Kirkland, which is, you know, probably 15 minutes from here and that was all over the news.
00:10:51 [W] I'm sure you probably all remember hearing about it, but it was spreading from person to person in a nursing home here in King County. So you can't ignore it. You can't pretend it's not going to happen. Like it's here.
00:11:02 [W] It's spreading people started dying and then very shortly after that. This was in the beginning of March Governor Jay Inslee close.
00:11:12 [W] Is this close the schools while Seattle close the school's Governor Jay Inslee had a quarantine initiated and we are all started realizing like this is here.
00:11:21 [W] This is scary.
00:11:21 [W] It's not going to go away and so rapid intervention was made in western Washington rapid intervention.
00:11:29 [W] Oh my gosh.
00:11:30 [W] I love it.
00:11:31 [W] So relevant.
00:11:32 [W] That's that's exactly what we want to see in in sort of a cloud knative system, right if something happens and you have some sort of alarm.
00:11:42 [W] In the case of Rachel it was you know, the governor sounding the alarm closing schools people dying you want to be able to do something.
00:11:51 [W] So in the case of doing any sort of forensics after an incident in computer science, the first thing you're wanting to do is you're going to want to be able to retell the story to understand what happens and and you're also going to want to be able to make sure that you bring your systems back
00:12:06 [W] Things offline.
00:12:04 [W] So what exactly does that look like?
00:12:06 [W] So this is where we get into the beauty of the cloud in the ability to take snapshots in the ability to recreate systems and replicate environments or perhaps to back up data such that you could actually go back in time and see what the state of the world was like at the time of
00:12:21 [W] That you can begin to piece it apart and make sense of it and build it back together.
00:12:00 [W] So an alarm could come from everything from perhaps a metric violation and Prometheus, but more importantly we look at Falco and its ability to trigger a runtime alarm when something unexpected happens in your kubernative cluster.
00:12:14 [W] So it'll trigger an alarm and you can respond to that in the same way that that Washington State responded to the coronavirus and ask people to quarantine inside in the case of Falco if you trigger an alarm you can then begin to coredns.
00:12:26 [W] Quarantine your nodes and kubernative and you can begin to isolate them such that whatever was infecting one of those nodes. You can make sure that it's no longer a horizontally spreading to to other nodes in the cluster and alleviating that horizontal attack Vector that you would see and this
00:12:42 [W] In the form of outages to some sort of malicious behavior.
00:12:39 [W] The point is you want to be able to respond to it quickly and in order to respond to it. You have to know about it in the first place.
00:12:49 [W] Okay, speaking of response.
00:12:51 [W] Let's talk about let's talk about response.
00:12:53 [W] One of the beautiful things about being an SRE or working in security is a lot of the time we actually carry a pager.
00:13:01 [W] I'm not sure.
00:13:02 [W] Have you ever been like on call like that before?
00:13:04 [W] Oh, yeah, definitely.
00:13:06 [W] Definitely. I remember I remember having
00:13:12 [W] Well, you get used to your pager going off at all hours when you're an intern and you have no control over your life to the point, where now something buzzes on me.
00:13:20 [W] I still this many years later have a little bit of that.
00:13:23 [W] Oh, no, they're my pager going off even though I'm not wearing a pagerduty more.
00:13:26 [W] So yeah. Yeah.
00:13:27 [W] Yeah. Yeah pagerduty is it's it's like a love-hate related to Haley. She just be honest.
00:13:35 [W] Yeah, so so, you know everybody remembers we had to go into quarantine.
00:13:39 [W] The big goal of quarantine, of course is to get the case number down.
00:13:42 [W] So because this is a disease that is spread between people when they are in close contact person to person primarily the goal is to have people stop being in close proximity reach it with each other to slow the spread.
00:13:55 [W] mean, there's some there's some faux might spread where somebody sneezes on a door handle and then you touch the door handle, but honestly the most the biggest way that chronosphere has spread is parsec.
00:14:04 [W] Like a love-hate related to Haverly she just be honest.
00:14:04 [W] Yeah, so so, you know everybody remembers we had to go into quarantine the Big Goal with quarantine, of course is to get the case number down.
00:14:11 [W] So because this is a disease that is spread between people when they are in close contact person to person primarily the goal is to have people stop being in close proximity reach it with each other to slow the spread.
00:14:24 [W] I mean, there's some there's some faux might spread where somebody sneezes on a door handle and then you touch the door handle, but honestly the most the biggest way that chronosphere has spread is
00:14:34 [W] Person inhaling particles that somebody coughed saying yelled spit out of their mouth into the air next to you you breathe in the particles. So we want to get the the replication number down below 1 so to explain what that means.
00:15:02 [W] Coughed saying yelled spit out of their mouth into the air next to you you breathe in the particles.
00:15:07 [W] So we want to get the the replication number down below 1 so to explain what that means.
00:15:14 [W] So the are not or the replication number of a disease is how many new cases you get from one infected individual.
00:15:22 [W] So initially, we thought that coronavirus had an R of about 2 to 3 in clusters and certain areas.
00:15:29 [W] It may be as high as 4 to 5.
00:15:31 [W] But we want that value down below one because if the number of new people infected from a current case is less than 1 the disease shrinks the disease will eventually go away if you keep that are below one different diseases have different infectious abilities. So
00:15:46 [W] Most incredibly infectious diseases. Somebody can have measles, you know cough or sneeze in a room and there are still meeting easels particles circulating around in that room hours and hours later.
00:15:57 [W] And so the are not for measles is 12 to 18.
00:15:59 [W] So twelve to eighteen new cases of measles will come from one infected person.
00:16:04 [W] So we a lot of you know, there's a lot of talk early on in March of like getting the are not below 1.
00:16:11 [W] know if you remember hearing about that, but it's a big goal. We're still not below one are not
00:16:16 [W] Crept down to about 1.2, but it's going back up. Again. It's about 1.4 21.6 right now.
00:16:23 [W] So we still have work to do.
00:16:25 [W] Awesome.
00:16:27 [W] Let's talk about quarantine in the name of kubernative. Right?
00:16:31 [W] So if we look at a traditional computer viruses and then how they were like to kubernative use the right away. The whole point of kubernative is is it gives you a set of abstractions that make it easy and convenient for you to access other pieces of your infrastructure in the same
00:16:47 [W] Which from an attackers perspective is fascinating because theoretically if once you compromise the often the off material you not only have access to other nodes in the cluster, but you have a wonderful set of tools that people put a lot of time and effort making it convenient
00:16:54 [W] Access other nodes in the cluster as well.
00:16:46 [W] So you see that same type of telescoping nature and those some type of curves that you would see in an infection spreading but in some sort of horizontal attack Vector in kubernative and there's a handful of those and if you're interested in getting involved, please reach out we can connect you with folks and six security.
00:17:01 [W] Talk about how you can get involved with not only the understanding the different attack vectors in the potentially known see bees but how you can prevent them moving forward.
00:17:08 [W] We also look at failure rates and how you can respond to them with things like cluster API, perhaps you you noticed that you have a handful of note. Some of them have been compromised and you want to grab some snapshots of them and take them down cluster.
00:17:23 [W] would be able to give you a set of tools to to mitigate that into a mutate those nodes at runtime. You could plug that into the rest of your
00:17:30 [W] or your backup system and that would actually be able to to take those down into drain the nodes in to get whatever infection was inside of your kubernative clustered offline such that you could bring up new immutable infrastructure along the side of it
00:17:45 [W] That can my camera died.
00:17:44 [W] But yes Network isolation is going to be a big part of quarantine. If you can alleviate the the infection or the malicious user at the network layer, you're going to drastically diminish their ability to communicate with other pieces of infrastructure with inside of
00:17:59 [W] System.
00:17:54 [W] So again, we see that quarantine isn't important here. But but more important than that the ability to take action and to understand that once you have one potential compromise you can you can see that spread to other parts of your infrastructure as well.
00:18:10 [W] Whoo, this is a good one.
00:18:12 [W] All right. So with the coronavirus there was a lot of information coming out really fast and there were some misinformation some of the early information was well-meaning and we thought it was probably good information, but it was
00:18:27 [W] quickly as possible without being peer reviewed or really can confirmed and so first we'll start with a good the good stuff was the Chinese government and the Chinese medical establishment worked incredibly quickly they
00:18:37 [W] Spent worked incredibly quickly they had so the first big government report of the chronosphere S being an actual disease in an issue is about December 31st or January 1st.
00:18:43 [W] They had the coronavirus genomes sequenced by January 12th.
00:18:48 [W] 12th that is mind-blowingly fast. And then they open sourced it. They put out the coronavirus genome globally and said, look, here's what we found and that allowed everybody to get started on potential vaccines.
00:19:01 [W] That much faster. So that was awesome PPE protocols.
00:19:05 [W] We got these lovely PDF downloads of exactly how to don and doff your PPE what PPE was required how to have teams how to have an observer how to they also had some a lot more somber things about how to take care of patients once they
00:19:20 [W] How to prevent spreading the virus from a deceased patient all of this was open sourced and passed out around the medical community around the world and undoubtedly saved a lot of lives by our Chinese colleagues and Medicine wanting to get this information out as fast as possible.
00:19:36 [W] There were missed there was a lot of misinformation.
00:19:27 [W] So at first there was a lot of talk about don't worry just make it till summer when it's warm.
00:19:32 [W] It's just going to go away.
00:19:33 [W] Well that didn't happen.
00:19:34 [W] There were small observational studies.
00:19:37 [W] There was one from France that touted the hydroxychloroquine plus or minus is with her meissen would decrease mortality rates from the from the chronosphere iris.
00:19:45 [W] was put out in a journal but it wasn't peer reviewed. It was kind of a nightmare because once it actually got peer reviewed in like for example, the the British medical journal, which I have a link here on this.
00:19:54 [W] I'd they couldn't replicate it and subsequent studies couldn't replicate it. And it's unfortunate because patients who actually need hydroxychloroquine to treat certain autoimmune diseases than couldn't find their absolutely critical medication because people had started
00:20:10 [W] Like hydroxychloroquine when it didn't even work for covid there was a lot of other misinformation about different medications.
00:20:13 [W] There was the there was the week where we all were too afraid to take NSAIDs.
00:20:16 [W] There was the week where hypertensive patients were afraid to take their blood pressure medicine because of ace inhibitor interaction with covid there were there was misinformation about how it gets transmitted about whether you know, if your delivery person delivers you an Amazon package and then you touch
00:20:32 [W] Going to die of coronavirus all sorts of misinformation on the internet. And so it was hard to know what to believe and what was going to change a week from now and what kind of mask works and what kind of Mask doesn't and then there were people saying don't worry.
00:20:38 [W] It's just like the flu only people who have a lot of medical conditions will actually die from it, which was both horrible to say but also turned out to be wrong. So the whole thing wound up with everybody in a state of panic initially.
00:20:53 [W] Yeah, and as we'll see in any if anybody here has ever been in a Disaster Response situation where production has gone offline or something has been compromised like exact same situation.
00:21:04 [W] Its people there's a state of panic and people are starting to assign blame and you go into this chaotic state of misinformation and speculation.
00:21:14 [W] So let's talk more about that.
00:21:17 [W] So the first thing Rachel mentioned was the importance of open sourcing information.
00:21:20 [W] So we see this in open source throughout the ecosystem.
00:21:23 [W] You also see this in security.
00:21:25 [W] If you do happen to discover a vulnerability, there is such a thing known as responsible disclosure that allows you to First give somebody an opportunity to fix it.
00:21:33 [W] And then once we fixed it, we're then able to roll out some sort of patch to the to the rest of the ecosystem as well.
00:21:39 [W] That so the first thing Rachel mentioned was the importance of open sourcing information.
00:21:41 [W] So we see this in open source throughout the ecosystem.
00:21:44 [W] And you also see this in security. If you do happen to discover a vulnerability there is such a thing known as responsible disclosure that allows you to First give somebody an opportunity to fix it.
00:21:54 [W] And then once we fixed it, we're then able to roll out some sort of patch to the to the rest of the ecosystem as well. But again this none of this would be possible without the concept of Open Source and sharing and realizing that that
00:22:06 [W] and coming together as a community is actually more important than trying to keep this to yourself for your own use case. So a huge lesson in humanity here in the importance of sharing information as needed after this.
00:22:20 [W] we look into post-mortem evaluation. So this is the the process the ceremony in which a you'll notice that a lot of anyway, we were talking about post-mortem evaluation and what that means and like I had mentioned it's cncf sir sighs of of
00:22:38 [W] Sharing information as needed after this. We look into post-mortem evaluation.
00:22:44 [W] So this is the the process the ceremony in which a you'll notice that a lot of anyway, we were talking about post-mortem evaluation and what that means and like I had mentioned it's cncf sir sighs of of getting together after some sort of event in trying
00:23:11 [W] The event in trying to to understand what happened is this process of going through with you and your team?
00:23:18 [W] Typically you're not assigning blame.
00:23:19 [W] It's not a Blame Fool exercise.
00:23:21 [W] You're just trying to discover what happened and the same way we see this with with the covid.
00:23:26 [W] It's how did it get here?
00:23:27 [W] how do we respond to it? And what do we do to prevent it from happening moving forward and so other misinformation you might see as you're going through a system is be aware of things like false positives and red herrings. So these are things that
00:23:41 [W] can come up where it may look like you're detecting the problem or it may look like you're actually understanding what's going on. But the the truth is if anybody here has ever de bugged a live production system before the truth is typically much much more Sinister and
00:23:56 [W] The involves DNS. Anyway, we're looking at correlation versus causation. Of course, everyone knows those two things don't necessarily have anything to do with each other and and last but not least we have speculation, which it can be a good thing if if you and your team are speculating.
00:24:11 [W] Perhaps some sort of attack Vector some sort of reason for your system is going down or some reason why your pods are getting him killed or something happening, but it isn't always necessarily the right thing and sometimes it's easy to get fooled by speculation to think that you've discovered it and that can actually
00:24:20 [W] Early the right thing and sometimes it's easy to get fooled by speculation to think that you've discovered it and that could actually end up causing more problems Downstream.
00:24:27 [W] So so the main takeaway here from a computer site reliability engineering perspective is just to be skeptical just to try to prove that instead of trying to prove things right try to prove them not wrong.
00:24:38 [W] It's a good rule of thumb that I like to follow.
00:24:42 [W] So moving on to really important Concepts here that I have already mentioned once prevention and detection and the the differences between the two and how they are both relevant both medical industry as well as computer science
00:24:58 [W] So moving on to really important Concepts here that I have already mentioned once prevention and detection and the the differences between the two and how they both relevant for both medical industry as well as computer science
00:25:26 [W] Look at this and security policy for humans.
00:25:29 [W] I like that nice.
00:25:32 [W] All right.
00:25:33 [W] Well, so we're all pretty good about knowing what we need to do to prevent covid-19 at this point.
00:25:38 [W] I mean, you've all heard it all over the news social media everywhere so masks wash your hands social distancing, but let me go back to mask so initially we thought that you had to have like, you know full moon suit has met and 95 everything
00:25:54 [W] I realized no it's blood spread by droplet. So, you know cute little cloth masks that your auntie makes you are probably good enough and then oh, but no maybe it is actually aerosolized and airborne. And so now we've gone back to health care providers
00:26:08 [W] That is dealing with somebody who potentially as covid or is known to have covid needs to go back to using and 95s but basically masks work masks decrease the spread.
00:26:17 [W] We now know that it's respiratory spread far more than on, you know by sneezing on a doorknob for example, so, you know wear masks.
00:26:25 [W] We also know I mean washing your hands, you know, it's like wash your hands we've all known this since we were little kids just wash your hands and then social distancing. So if
00:26:35 [W] We stay six feet apart from each other. But you know, is it exactly six feet know? It's somewhere around six feet further is better.
00:26:42 [W] Are you outside are there are currents to disperse the droplets faster. Do you are you somewhere where they have a really good HEPA filter?
00:26:49 [W] And also we you really want to decrease the number of particles you inhale? That's another reason why we think that cloth masks are helpful, even if they don't keep out, you know, a hundred percent of covid particles because there seems to be a correlation between
00:27:04 [W] Articles you inhale and how sick you get so it's thought that people who inhale a whole lot of covid virions get a lot sicker than people who may have only inhaled a few again.
00:27:14 [W] We're still learning about this.
00:27:15 [W] We're still learning you know monthly there's new information coming out.
00:27:19 [W] So just because we said one thing a few months ago and now we're seeing another I mean that's science. That's what's good about science with more evidence you have new information to go on so it's still evolving and unfortunately,
00:27:32 [W] Unlike other diseases we don't have a preventive medication yet.
00:27:36 [W] We don't have a vaccine yet.
00:27:37 [W] We don't have a way to really prevent it from that standpoint.
00:27:40 [W] So we're still stuck with wear a mask wash your hands and still keep social distancing.
00:27:48 [W] Let's talk about prevention in kubernative sand Cloud native.
00:27:51 [W] It's the exact same thing.
00:27:53 [W] It's a list of things you and your team can do to try to prevent it from happening to you.
00:27:58 [W] I mean, that's exactly exactly what we're doing here. Were your were coming up with tools and techniques to try and prevent unwanted Behavior unwanted actions from taking place and the stronger our prevention technology is the stronger our prevention
00:28:13 [W] Chin in kubernative sand Cloud knative.
00:27:59 [W] It's the exact same thing.
00:28:00 [W] It's a list of things you and your team can do to try to prevent it from happening to you.
00:28:04 [W] I mean, that's exactly exactly what we're doing here.
00:28:07 [W] Were your were coming up with tools and techniques to try and prevent unwanted Behavior unwanted actions from taking place and the stronger our prevention technology is the stronger our prevention policy is the healthier our system is going to be
00:28:34 [W] The healthier our system is going to be I mean, it's literally a one to one relationship just like Rachel was talking about.
00:28:40 [W] So the first thing is is role-based Access Control Access Control who can do what can this group of users access this system can this group group of users access that system and how well are these systems defined how many parts of the system are actually
00:28:55 [W] To this access control and that's where we get into things like admissions controller, which allow you to control what is and is not admitted into your kubernative cluster furthermore. We can take that a step further and look at things like security balls.
00:29:08 [W] This is everything from pods security policy to Opa open policy agent Opa and other concrete implementations like gatekeeper.
00:29:16 [W] So you were starting to look at how we're expressing what people can and can't do what users can and can't do what clients can and can't do inside of our kubernative.
00:29:25 [W] I T's cluster and the more rigorous our security policy is at preventing these things from happening the less likely it is that our cluster is going to get compromised or that we're going to get sick.
00:29:36 [W] So yes, there are things that are very very identical to masks like they're not foolproof.
00:29:42 [W] Like if you for instance if you look at our back if you run a privilege container in our bag in an are back cluster where you only have access to a given name space, you can still ask lay it down to the node compromise the entire cluster and escalate out of that namespace.
00:29:55 [W] But it's still effective for people who don't know about that attack Vector a well-known attack Factory that's been out for years.
00:30:00 [W] So again, we're in that were in the situation where like we're just trying to strengthen our preventive techniques in order to minimize the amount of potential compromise.
00:30:09 [W] We see Downstream we go and take that further with things like regression testing.
00:30:13 [W] processes which users Can it can execute which system calls at the end of the day all applications need to translate to the colonel somehow and that's where things like grpc come into play that ultimately translate directly into system calls and if we're able to control
00:30:22 [W] Scan of can't execute various system calls were able to control which parts of our cluster and parts of our system can and can't get sick.
00:30:28 [W] So we see this all throughout the ecosystem and it's absolutely critical for any type of security policy.
00:30:34 [W] It's just like washing your hands.
00:30:36 [W] You've gotta wash your hands. You've got to turn on our back.
00:30:43 [W] Okay.
00:30:44 [W] All right.
00:30:44 [W] We're testing detection.
00:30:47 [W] How do we figure out who has covid or early to prevent more spreading?
00:30:52 [W] So in medicine every test has sensitivity specificity and specificity. So sensitivity is if somebody has a disease and you test them for it, do you actually pick it up and then specificity is if you test somebody and your test comes back
00:31:07 [W] We have the disease or is it a false positive?
00:31:07 [W] So it's not enough for a test to be really sensitive but not specific or vice versa.
00:31:12 [W] It has to be sensitive and specific to really be able to trust your results.
00:31:16 [W] So right now we have rapid testing like, you know, point-of-care testing all these well sports teams politicians, they keep getting tested frequently in rapidly.
00:31:29 [W] It hasn't really been rolled out to the general population yet, unfortunately, and then we have pcr-based lab contribute confirmatory testing, so
00:31:35 [W] It's the swab that everybody knows about that goes way up and the joke is its brain biopsy because it goes so far back.
00:31:41 [W] It has to go to the lab. It takes hours to come back.
00:31:44 [W] Generally.
00:31:45 [W] It's functionally you get your result in a day or two.
00:31:48 [W] I mean that's not really good enough to really be able to quell the spread. So we want rapid testing. The problem is rapid testing is not as sensitive as lab confirmatory PCR testing.
00:31:59 [W] So the question is, is that okay though, and it turns out there's an infectious disease expert Paul sacks.
00:32:05 [W] Strongly is pushing for Rapid testing everybody as frequently as they want to be tested widespread testing.
00:32:13 [W] Even if it's not a sensitive because if you can test more people quickly cheaply repeatedly you're going to do a better job of lower sensitivity. Then you would with a very high sensitivity High specificity test that you can only do in a limited basis that takes days to come back.
00:32:29 [W] Allergies are just hurting themselves. We see this exact same thing and communities you want to be able to check the false positives and in some cases as you're debugging your systems from a site reliability engineering perspective.
00:32:34 [W] It's just about getting things out there and I would rather have you know, if I have a thousand notes of my cluster, I would rather know that 90% of them are up and running and healthy, then know that none of them are up and running and healthy, especially if that 90% of them that are healthy.
00:32:49 [W] With a small amount of uncertainty, right?
00:32:43 [W] So that's where we're getting into like the computer science terms of having a false positive or proving something that looks like it's actually not working when all in actuality it is so we're the lesson here is quantity over quality
00:32:58 [W] It's actually not working when all in actuality it is so we're the lesson here is quantity over quality patches, and these patches can be everything from software patches to actual system infrastructure patches, but we're trying to get things out there to get our
00:33:10 [W] Or patches to actual system infrastructure patches, but we're trying to get things out there to get our systems back online and back as healthy as possible as quick as possible.
00:33:19 [W] Furthermore.
00:33:20 [W] We look at other detection pivot is like Falco.
00:33:22 [W] I mean we we take it down to the system call layer. And if you want to come in and see what's going on at the colonel Falco is going to be the number one way for you to take that information and pull it up into user space so that you could start detecting runtime security anomalies and they're just already a complete rule set to find for you so that you can
00:33:37 [W] What's happening out there for testing look no further than the regression testing.
00:33:42 [W] You can write a regression test for more than just software.
00:33:44 [W] If something goes into your system and violates the network or violates the kernel or violates the infrastructure of violates your storage. You can write a regression test for that. If you have a good infrastructure testing Suite set up and running.
00:33:55 [W] So again, it's just about knowing what's going on once, you know, you're able to make decisions.
00:34:01 [W] We all remember what it was like at the beginning of quarantine where nobody knew what was going on and I was very stressful time for us to actually make anynines.
00:34:07 [W] Concrete plans for our families because we didn't know what was going on.
00:34:10 [W] So in computer science, please please please understand the value of Simply being able to say if something is true or false.
00:34:22 [W] All right. Let's talk about the future.
00:34:24 [W] Let's talk about the vaccine or as I like to put it is. Oh my God, somebody finally patched open SSL, which I've if anybody here is ever follow the openness to sell as he he's over the past few years.
00:34:35 [W] This is quite a very exciting moment for the internet when something like this happens,
00:34:42 [W] The vaccine of course, everybody is hoping he will come out like yesterday what we're going to need though.
00:34:49 [W] Once we have a vaccine. We need a vaccine it's going to achieve 70% immunity and where that number comes from is the concept of herd immunity.
00:34:57 [W] We need the vaccine to both be deployed widely enough that everybody can get it.
00:35:02 [W] for the internet when something like this happens
00:35:03 [W] It's the vaccine of course.
00:35:06 [W] Everybody is hoping he will come out like yesterday what we're going to need though.
00:35:11 [W] Once we have a vaccine. We need a vaccine it's going to achieve 70% immunity and where the number comes from is the concept of herd immunity. We need the vaccine to both be deployed widely enough that everybody can get it.
00:35:25 [W] Or at least about 94% of us can get it and then we need that vaccine to work on as many people as possible.
00:35:34 [W] So let's take an example of a vaccine that's been out forever that we know about which is the pertussis vaccine the whooping cough vaccine.
00:35:42 [W] We all get it as a kid several times. We get updates throughout our life. It's commonly called the Tdap. It comes with a tetanus vaccine.
00:35:49 [W] It turns out there's a certain percentage of the community that is never going to mount a response an immune response to
00:35:55 [W] Whooping cough no matter how many times you get in the backseat.
00:35:58 [W] So what we have to do is give the vaccine to 94 percent at least of the population.
00:36:03 [W] That's the target so that those people who never mount a vaccine.
00:36:06 [W] It doesn't really matter.
00:36:07 [W] There aren't enough Target for the disease to keep spreading throughout the community.
00:36:11 [W] So once the spec spec scene comes out, we still aren't going to be you know back to life as normal until enough of us get vaccinated that 70 percent of the folks in the world.
00:36:23 [W] immune. So that means either
00:36:25 [W] either 70% of people get vaccinated and it works a hundred percent of the time or a hundred percent of the people get vaccinated and it works 70% of the time vaccine phases come in three phases Phase 1 & 2 are basically to prove that number one. The vaccine actually does what we think it does on a very small scale
00:36:40 [W] That it is safe.
00:36:42 [W] Like we don't give you the vaccine and then you get some horrible autoimmune disease or you don't die from it in an extreme example. So there are multiple vaccine candidates that have gone through Phase 1 and Phase 2 and we have several now that are in a phase three, which is where we start vaccinating.
00:36:57 [W] Thousands of people Volunteers Of course thousands of people well in the u.s. There are volunteers in other countries, they've taken different approaches where people are given as much choice of whether they get the vaccine or not. But in the u.s.
00:37:03 [W] it's volunteers and then we have to wait for enough time to see if these volunteers actually developed the disease at the same rate as other people who are not vaccinated or if they develop or if they don't develop the disease and the vaccine works and then 1 Space 3 is completed then
00:37:18 [W] We roll it out to the general population.
00:37:20 [W] that's going to take a while. I am not in the practice of predicting the future.
00:37:24 [W] So I wish I could tell you what day what month it's going to happen.
00:37:27 [W] I can't but things are moving along and things are moving along a lot more quickly than they have in the past for any other vaccine that we've tried to make.
00:37:39 [W] All right.
00:37:40 [W] So let's talk about patching production. Right?
00:37:42 [W] So this is the analogous of this what how do we how do we cure production if something goes wrong?
00:37:47 [W] So let's say that there was a malicious user that violated our system and came into our production cluster and started doing something.
00:37:54 [W] Let's say they were mining for Bitcoin and we wanted to go and fix that. Well, the first thing we're going to do is we have to stop it from from from spreading any further. The second thing we have to do is we have to get rid of the user and we probably want to understand how that happened and that was the point.
00:38:09 [W] Of the exercise of the post-mortem. And now that we understand that we are ready to update our security policy and update our security posture such that we would prevent this from ever happening again.
00:38:21 [W] So this is a way of effectively introducing a new change into our system that will that will prevent this malicious user for coming back in and taking some sort of action and causing harm later.
00:38:33 [W] So how we do that is we typically want to deploy something whether it's a patch to production a new container images.
00:38:39 [W] Or a new artifact for our application perhaps it's not even has nothing to do with our application.
00:38:45 [W] It's part of the the software running on top of some cases.
00:38:48 [W] It could be part of kubernative itself and some cases. It could be part of Lennox itself.
00:38:52 [W] Regardless, we want to make sure that we are able to prove beyond the shadow of a doubt that this is in fact what we want to be deploying once we actually deployed to production and that's where image Providence in artifact Providence comes into play proving that it is what we think it is making sure that
00:39:07 [W] We're not somehow compromised as we're trying to inject the new fix into our system.
00:39:12 [W] We look at Concepts like a and be testing that allow you to have an older or vulnerable set of infrastructure out there and then flip back and forth between the recently patched and the Legacy system to see if there's any differences to see if anything has gone wrong with the
00:39:27 [W] Change and that allows you to do things like slowly dial into the new system so that you're not just doing a cold cut over and uncompromising every piece of infrastructure in your cluster.
00:39:36 [W] And that's where partial patching comes into play Just you could start off with 10 percent moves up to 25 50 75 80 90, and then finally the whole thing's kind over and again, this is a perfect example of this is patchiness of cell, right?
00:39:49 [W] what there's a vulnerability it's in every piece of software but virtually out there and then how do we go through and how do we begin to fix that across the the board for?
00:39:57 [W] Us and that can be a tedious process.
00:39:59 [W] So so making sure that you have a good story in place for how you're going to go and Patch. This is going to be critical furthermore. If you're not even fixing anything, which is having the story in place in the first place is going to be a critical part of your stack as you begin to look a tad opting and using kubermatic.
00:40:19 [W] Alright, so for any disaster, you have to have a response plan in place and for covid-19.
00:40:24 [W] That's really been super challenging this year as I'm sure everybody is fully aware.
00:40:29 [W] Although I guess it depends on which part of the world you live in but in the United States, there was a pandemic response working group that was proposed back in 2016.
00:40:41 [W] 2016. It involves scientists. It was a working group to make a planetscale.
00:40:48 [W] Because it was apparent that based on our history.
00:40:52 [W] There is going to be a pandemic again at some point.
00:40:55 [W] We already knew about ebola we knew about SARS the first time around we knew about the global floopy endemic back in 1918 1919. So there so the in 2016 the government had a robust plan this has
00:41:10 [W] It unfortunately was disregarded and not put into place in the United States when it was actually needed, but previously there had been a plan but this is a good example.
00:41:23 [W] You need to have a plan.
00:41:24 [W] You can't just wait until something bad happens and then scramble retroactively.
00:41:27 [W] you should always be proactive about the sort of stuff. We should have strategic stock piles of PPE.
00:41:33 [W] Apparently the United States had the stockpile. I can't speak for other countries, but the US had
00:41:39 [W] a stockpile it did not get deployed efficiently.
00:41:43 [W] We also have a u.s.
00:41:44 [W] Stockpile of critical medications including antibiotics, like for example antibiotics against against Anthrax Airway and breathing medications things that are absolutely critical.
00:41:55 [W] We do have a national stockpile of that and then you have to have a Deployable chain of command that is you know, identified in advance and then able to be rapidly deployed a phrase. I used earlier rapid deployment of pre-planned.
00:42:09 [W] As and not wait retroactively to scramble once it is Esther happens beautiful.
00:42:16 [W] Absolutely couldn't agree enough.
00:42:18 [W] This is the first thing I tell people when I walk into an SRE team, especially new SRE team is what you gonna do when something breaks.
00:42:26 [W] What are you going to do when you know, it's the fan and that's it.
00:42:31 [W] That's a real conversation that a lot of people aren't prepared for or even more. So there's this like this this false hope that we are prepared for it, but nobody actually knows where the manual is and we see that a lot a lot Disaster Recovery because it's you know, it's never going to happen to you. And of course some tool
00:42:46 [W] It does so being prepared is it is a huge lesson anytime you're looking at like doing any sort of resilient distributed systems engineering.
00:42:53 [W] So the first steps to recovering a system you have to roll back you have to revert if you are not ready at the push of a button to go back to the last release to go back to a known working state to just get the system back online so that you can stop and breathe for a moment.
00:43:09 [W] So that you can figure out what's going on in what you want to do. Next. You're going to be in a really rough time when disaster does inevitably strike.
00:43:15 [W] We also see chain of command somebody's on call and they get a notification that notification has escalated to an alert that alert to a critical alert next thing, you know, and your production system is offline.
00:43:26 [W] You're compromised something's going on.
00:43:28 [W] And what's next?
00:43:30 [W] Who do you call?
00:43:31 [W] What button do you push?
00:43:32 [W] Which email do you send?
00:43:33 [W] Where do you go? There's nothing worse than getting a page at three o'clock in the morning and feeling componentconfig.
00:43:38 [W] Pletely isolated all alone without knowing what to do next and trying to fix the entire thing by yourself.
00:43:43 [W] So having a chain of command knowing the next steps and it being second nature so that you don't even have to think about it is going to be critical to any sort of healthy response plan documentation, right?
00:43:53 [W] Where do I go?
00:43:54 [W] What do I do? Which book do I pick up?
00:43:57 [W] Which page do I turn to these are all important things that are going to be critical as you and your team start actually being in the moment at runtime recovering from some sort of incident and last but not least a regression.
00:44:08 [W] Regression is just a fancy way of saying I want to prevent this from happening again.
00:44:12 [W] So in computer science, we write regression test. These are ways of proving that you and your system are not going to be vulnerable or liable to the same thing that they were in the past.
00:44:23 [W] So not only understanding the regression but then later testing against it to make sure it's not happening again is going to be absolutely critical for you and your team
00:44:33 [W] So again, let's let's do a quick overview.
