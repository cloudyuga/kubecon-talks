00:00:00 [W] Hello everyone. Welcome to the stock intro plus deep dive provider IBM cloud.
00:00:05 [W] My name is sidhu Salah.
00:00:08 [W] Would you like to introduce yourself, please?
00:00:11 [W] Yeah, definitely.
00:00:11 [W] I'm Richard. I say working on IBM cloud provider for kubernative and openshift also co-lead with saw that on the cloud provider project for IBM cloud files.
00:00:23 [W] Hi everyone.
00:00:24 [W] I'm Brad Topol.
00:00:26 [W] I'm IBM's distinguished engineer for open Technologies and developer. Advocacy.
00:00:30 [W] I lead a large team that contributes Upstream to kubernative. He's and I'm a kubernative contributor of Kudo container and share of the kubernative Sig doc localization subgroup.
00:00:44 [W] Well, thank you Richard and brat.
00:00:47 [W] All right. So in today's talk, we will provide an overview of see cloud provider.
00:00:53 [W] There will be a separate task force equal operator itself.
00:00:58 [W] So, you know, I would highly recommend you to attend that to know more about the cloud for your sake. But in this talk, I will just briefed about it being the provider IBM cloud is sub-project off the cyclic order.
00:01:11 [W] We'll talk about the structure and activities of the provider IBM Cloud project.
00:01:16 [W] And that would be followed by Deep dive to IBM cloud provider and cluster API provider IBM Cloud.
00:01:27 [W] Spoken kubernative it owns Cuban is cloud provider interface.
00:01:22 [W] This interface is responsible for running all the cloud provider specific control groups.
00:01:27 [W] Are you can find more about the you know code at the URL that I have provided here the sick. It ensures that the Cubans ecosystem is evolving in a way that is neutral to all cloud provider.
00:01:43 [W] There are specific control groups.
00:01:25 [W] Are you can find more about the you know code at the URL that I have provided here the sick. It ensures that the Cubans ecosystem is evolving in a way that is neutral to all cloud provider.
00:02:18 [W] There's no flavor given to one Club provider or other and you know, everybody's everybody can participate in the ongoing discussions and you know, the implementation of specific cloud provider.
00:02:34 [W] The seagull so ensures a consistent and high quality user experience across different Cloud providers and it owns all the sub projects.
00:02:44 [W] They were formerly known as you know, Sig themselves, you know for different Cloud providers like CWS or Sig for us you gcp or zebrium Cloud SQL can stack
00:02:59 [W] We're and so on the prodyna IBM Cloud.
00:03:03 [W] It's a surprise egg of this sig cloud provider.
00:03:07 [W] As I mentioned. There will be separate talk on see cloud cover itself.
00:03:11 [W] So I would highly recommend you attend that to know more about the carburetor see then you can also see and refer documentation in the URL that I have mentioned at the at the bottom of the slide rest of this talk will
00:03:27 [W] provider IBM cloud
00:03:21 [W] Already, so this sub-project of you know cloudbees are seeing it's it's round building deploying maintaining supporting and using Cuban is an IBM cloud.
00:03:33 [W] you know, it will will provide you a platform to interact with the team, you know, the IBM team and and others that you know, the building operates IBM cloud.
00:03:49 [W] And and you know, we openly discuss, you know things like, you know kind of contributions and all meant that you know, we will be doing in the committee's committee from the IBM Cloud perspective and you know as part of
00:04:04 [W] Project as an active member or just following it, you know, you get to follow the evolution of the IBM Cloud platforms with respect to Cuba Indies and you know related cncf projects.
00:04:14 [W] So the structure of the project, you know, when you talk about it, we have three colleagues call it m is from IBM multi-cloud manager side.
00:04:15 [W] We have Richard T's which one of the speaker here today?
00:04:18 [W] He represents IBM Cloud Cuban service and red hat opentelemetry service and the myself. I am representing more from open source software side.
00:04:34 [W] You can find some the link here.
00:04:37 [W] that will be useful, you know, like mailing list. So I would highly recommend to be part of the mailing list to get updates on the project.
00:04:46 [W] We have a slack Channel which the provider IBM Cloud slack, you know highly recommend to be you know to to be there to see what's going on and we provide the updates
00:05:01 [W] They're regularly and you can find more about the project documentation on the on the link. I provided here on for the guitar.
00:05:10 [W] But activities we meet every month. So it's last Wednesday at 2:00 p.m. Eastern time.
00:05:19 [W] We have a 30 to 45 minutes for some time and I were meeting depending on the agenda now all the recordings for the meeting are also available.
00:05:31 [W] if you have missed the past meetings, if you cannot attend future meetings, you can refer to the videos and take a look.
00:05:42 [W] we regularly participate in the Sig club for directional activities, you know, they're bi-weekly meetings and other things the project Owens sub-project called cluster API provided IBM Cloud,
00:05:57 [W] And extension of the cluster API project of kubenetes, right? So the cluster API project itself a sub-project of Cuban it is and it provides, you know, optional editing functionality is on top of
00:06:02 [W] The lifecycle of humans cluster Brad will be giving more details there later in this presentation.
00:05:59 [W] And then, you know, we are staying on top of support for out of three IBM cloud provider in see cloud provider and you know that discussion has been going on for for some longtime in the meetings through
00:06:14 [W] Just through the different tasks that some of the provider specific code which were part of the kubenetes core.
00:06:22 [W] They are taken outside and that's cloud of pre-show ritual will provide a deep dive on to the IBM cloud provider and you also cover the out of three topic there.
00:06:36 [W] With that Richard I would hand it over to you.
00:06:39 [W] All right.
00:06:41 [W] thank you.
00:06:42 [W] So, yeah, I'll be taking you through Ikea's rocks and our cloud provider and we'll start here on IKS, which is IBM cloud kubernative service, which is IBM's managed kubernative service so you can create group clusters and IBM cloud
00:06:57 [W] Taking you through IKS rocks and our cloud provider and we'll start here on IQs, which is IBM cloud kubernative service, which is IBM's managed kubernative service so you can create group clusters and IBM cloud and there's a lot of other managed Services
00:07:12 [W] Other managed Services out there and so in a similar fashion to those we are certified kubernative provider through the cncf certification program for kubernative.
00:07:22 [W] So if you'd like more information on that service, you can check out the link on the docks there and we try to keep updated on you know, what's going on and I KS and post things on the select channels to keep you updated on those activities and our meetings as well.
00:07:37 [W] That pure the next slide, please.
00:07:39 [W] Yeah. Sure.
00:07:40 [W] Thank you.
00:07:41 [W] So this year we've already provided three releases of IKS based upon their Associated kublr leases that were out and when we were talking last year at this time, we were touting 116 just came out right now.
00:07:56 [W] You can see in this chart here. We support what 17 18 and 19, which is the three latest releases from this year and 116 is already deprecated so you can see a twitch.
00:08:07 [W] Which the speed at which kubernative moves it's pretty significant and are 115 releases now on supported it. Just wanted to put it on the go.
00:08:15 [W] So one of the things that take away for a lot of folks from they get on board and kubernative.
00:08:20 [W] Is that a moves fast and that you have to have a plan for change right away so you can keep current so there's been a lot of discussions in the coop Community about this and certainly impacts users directly that are working with kubeedge and those obviously
00:08:35 [W] Which provide kubernative is a service or a product right?
00:08:37 [W] They're built on the the service iterations in the service Cadence from kubernative.
00:08:43 [W] So, you know a lot of folks are try to stay current there was a discussion on the long-term support for kubernative what that might look like a few things change this year with covid and other things happen. The delay of 119 release was noted
00:08:58 [W] 116 was extended for a little bit more having support ideally trying to allow people to maybe only have to upgrade once a year their clusters.
00:08:58 [W] So in the net the current discussion that is going on in the community and feel free to contribute to that is whether or not troops should have three releases a year or for and right now what I've seen is a little bit more weighted towards three people prefer,
00:09:13 [W] Keep keep your feedback coming to the community so they can make good decisions on these things.
00:09:15 [W] And as far as patch releases kubernative great job this year getting I very good Cadence on delivery patches for the support of releases.
00:09:25 [W] They generally do it monthly about mid-month. They patch all the releases at the same time, which has been really helpful, especially for managed services, and I'm sure for products as well to be able to deliver those patches quickly and in a timely matter, very consistent manner.
00:09:39 [W] Now and we've been doing that as well.
00:09:41 [W] next slide, please.
00:09:45 [W] So red hat openshift on IBM cloud or the red hat opentracing kubernetes Services another managed service again Opa just built on kubernative.
00:09:53 [W] So this is a also a kubernative certified offering through the cncf and and red hat Builds on that kubernative based capability to give you some additional functions with Brad.
00:10:05 [W] We'll talk about a little bit later and if you want more information, I included a link there for for openshift and next slide, please.
00:10:14 [W] For the release standpoints, we've delivered three releases of rocks this year.
00:10:19 [W] So very similar Cadence to IKS.
00:10:22 [W] You can see each version of openshift is based on a version of kubernative.
00:10:26 [W] They will be following that up and delivering that through the managed Service as well.
00:10:26 [W] So you can see the impact of the velocity of kubernative.
00:10:30 [W] He's carries over to the velocity of open ship.
00:10:34 [W] They're also moving very quickly now on the chart here we show for three four and five.
00:10:39 [W] There also is a long-term support from openshift and red hat on 3/11 that's based on kublr 11. So that has a been extended life.
00:10:49 [W] life. We fully expect for a version of for I believe 4.6 will be
00:10:52 [W] more of an extended life version from OB shift to give you that that additional support but buried in mind that obviously kubeedge is not supported 111 for quite some time.
00:11:04 [W] Alright next slide, please just yeah one back if you thank you.
00:11:11 [W] No problem. All right, so we have our bike. Yes. We have rocks.
00:11:16 [W] They're both built on kubeacademy. One thing that's very noticeable when you look at kubernative. It's very
00:11:23 [W] Likable a lot of interfaces whether it's through like the API level crd he's in such the cloud providers no different and there's various unique functionalities in each cloud and that we need to provide through kubernative.
00:11:38 [W] Controlled interface that interface is the the clock controller manager or the CCM through the cloud provider.
00:11:40 [W] So that's the architecture that kubernative has today to support various clouds and we leverage this architecture both of our managed services.
00:11:51 [W] So on the control plane side is where you find the API server scheduler The Coop controller manager and it's also where you find in our managed Services the cloud controller manager, which is
00:12:03 [W] the key aspect of taking advantage of the cloud specific features that you need to deliver some of those key aspects of kubernative so that you come to expect now on the worker node sides where you have the kubeedge qu proxy, you know, they're obviously running on
00:12:18 [W] The cloud controller manager, which is the key aspect of taking advantage of the cloud specific features that you need to deliver. Some of those key aspects of kubernative so that you come to expect now on the worker node sides where you have the
00:12:35 [W] It's in the cloud and those don't know longer have direct connections to the cloud. If you will that was under the old architecture they used to do that direct Connection Center trying to free that up so that the control loops
00:12:50 [W] Are contained and it's much cleaner interface going forward so that the code that used to live in kubernative can more easily be extracted dependencies can be broken that were specific to Cloud providers that we could
00:13:05 [W] Rolled out into their own repositories team to make it easier for everybody to both consume kubernetes, but also to build called specific features for kubernative.
00:13:16 [W] So with that next slide, please so this the cloud provider interface has several key interface interface functions that it provides the the biggest one for most
00:13:32 [W] The load balancer so that is the interface where you're going to deliver a load balancer service to kubernative.
00:13:35 [W] He's so kubernative is going to call the cloud provider to create delete update load balancers for the IBM cloud provider depending on whether you're running on classic infrastructure or EPC our next gen infrastructure.
00:13:50 [W] You have a little bit different load balancers that are available. So in the classic you have a network load balancer based on ipbs or or IP tables.
00:13:59 [W] It's runs in cluster. And then when you go to the VP see if a structure you've got a litter layer 7 load balancer and then you also have a network load balancer, which is new in our 119 release that we just delivered.
00:14:12 [W] There's also the instances which is another huge one huge component to the cloud provider, which is managing the nodes in particular you want to know say where the zone region instance type of the nodes so that can be data
00:14:27 [W] Network load balancer based on I could be S or or iptables it's runs in cluster. And then when you go to the VPC infrastructure, you've got a litter layer 7 load balancer and then you also have a network load balancer, which is new in our
00:15:37 [W] Nettie's for important aspects of scheduling and so on. So those are those are important pieces now being the managed service a lot of the bootstrapping happens is part of the managed service and we take advantage of that through the cloud provider to deliver that data to
00:15:53 [W] The community is moved with this you architecture.
00:15:56 [W] They saw the need for a new instances V2 interface as part of the cloud provider that was new and 119 as an alpha.
00:16:04 [W] It's going to progress.
00:16:06 [W] I'm hoping to Abate and we're looking at taking advantage of that. It's a little bit more streamlined interface to align with the new design of the cloud providers.
00:16:15 [W] And then we do do some implementation for zones, which is needed for load balancer and scheduling we don't do anything for clusters and routes.
00:16:24 [W] We rely on the cni-genie.
00:16:37 [W] All right next slide.
00:16:40 [W] Okay, and so a little bit about the future. So as always I don't have it on here, but we continually take the data that we collect through running kubernative both within the managed service base kubenetes and then
00:16:55 [W] Shift at not managed service through Red Hat.
00:16:57 [W] They're delivering what we know and back to the kubernative community what we learn to running kubernative.
00:17:05 [W] zat scale problem security things enhancements feedback. We always try to deliver that back also being part of the cloud provider.
00:17:13 [W] We're looking to expand our role here, especially if we can open source. Our IBM cloud provider things are aligning a little bit better as
00:17:22 [W] a coupe Community Works to extract in my grade all those entry providers out a tree making it a lot more easier to work on dependency management builds release processes.
00:17:32 [W] They're all coming together to make it it is to a point where this is going to be much easier for for all called providers to to deliver in the future.
00:17:41 [W] So with that we'll be looking at improving our docs or be able to test released processes aligning our gold dependency management with what kubernative does. So these are all the activities that were.
00:17:53 [W] Right now and in the future and that is it, I'll turn it over to Brad.
00:18:00 [W] Thank you Richard.
00:18:00 [W] Yep.
00:18:01 [W] So the IBM cloud provider project has as a sub-project the cluster API provider IBM cloud sub-project, and if you're not familiar with the cluster API provider projects and kubernative
00:18:16 [W] Kubernative stes.
00:18:07 [W] So these are all the activities that were working on right now and in the future and that is it, I'll turn it over to Brad.
00:18:16 [W] Thank you Richard.
00:18:17 [W] Yep.
00:18:17 [W] So the IBM cloud provider project has as a sub-project the cluster API provider IBM cloud sub-project, and if you're not familiar with the cluster API provider projects and kubernative
00:18:47 [W] They provide a declared of model or approach and tooling to simplify the provisioning upgrading and operating of clusters.
00:18:57 [W] And so we have our active project in this space the cluster API provider IBM cloud and just to just to see some of the basics here.
00:19:08 [W] There's always a Target cluster.
00:19:10 [W] That's the cluster we intend to create and manage.
00:19:13 [W] There's the bootstrap cluster that is typically a smaller cluster or
00:19:17 [W] that's used to help get things started and helps helps to manage that Target cluster.
00:19:21 [W] There is a cluster of control command.
00:19:25 [W] So there is a command line interface that is makes life easy and makes it easy to run the the types of commands for managing the Clusters and you know IBM as one of many vendors that that has embraced, you know this
00:19:41 [W] So you can see the architecture here on the right. If you're interested again, we have an active project in this space and feel free to go check it out and see what the team is working on lately.
00:19:53 [W] I saw they're working on some upgrades.
00:19:54 [W] So feel free to check that out next chart. Please oughta just so one question that we always get in this session.
00:20:04 [W] The one question that always comes up is what's the difference between kubernative and openshift and
00:20:11 [W] So we're going to go ahead and address it now because I'm sure it'll come up in the questions but openshift is a kubernative distribution from red hat that includes extra tooling to simplify Cloud native development and also provides automation automated
00:20:26 [W] So when you start doing development for a cloud native applications, if you're just getting started and you're going to start running in production and requires a lot of skills, right, so you need to be able to
00:20:38 [W] You can start running in production.
00:20:29 [W] It requires a lot of skills, right?
00:20:31 [W] So you need to be able to create container images and you typically need to know how to find a base image and then take your code and merge it into the base image and create the new image and push it to a registry
00:20:49 [W] And if you work with kubevirt idee, well, maybe you're an expert at that and that's not so difficult.
00:20:54 [W] But if you're a large organization and you say have lots of java programmers lots of python developers.
00:21:02 [W] These are folks who want to get the benefit of cloud native, but maybe don't have all those Cloud native skills. So one of the things that open ship provides is image creation and deployment tooling that makes it real easy for a developer to just push a change to a git Repository.
00:21:17 [W] Rory this is called source to Emma.
00:21:19 [W] Jh8 and and through openshift. It's able to recognize that find the right base image merge your new code changes into the base image and push it to a registry.
00:21:31 [W] And so taking care of all those details as reducing the amount of friction for a developer who doesn't work in Cloud native every day and is an expert at Docker configs. And and what have you to be able to get up and running
00:21:46 [W] In run their application and a cloud native fashion and a kubernative environment.
00:21:51 [W] So open ship will also give you image and configuration change detection.
00:21:56 [W] The other thing that openshift does that's nice is it provides security guard rails?
00:22:01 [W] So when you run in production compared to running and just your development environment you need to worry about security and in kubernative is there's a lot of knobs that you need to turn to get the the role-based access control, correct.
00:22:15 [W] One of the things that openshift provides our security contacts or security profiles that make it much easier for developer to get the right security that they need for production out of the box and not have to do a lot of Knob turning
00:22:30 [W] Dividual values that they're either guessing are properly configured or not.
00:22:22 [W] Similarly openshift in its default form is going to prevent privilege containers by refer running by default.
00:22:32 [W] And again why that's important is a privilege containers something that would have root access and if somehow there's a security breach those types of containers can cause way more harm than non-privileged containers. So openshift is going to protect you in that way.
00:22:47 [W] And also also try and deter you from running with the default namespace again that can cause some security issues as well.
00:22:54 [W] So a lot of tools to help you get up and running and provide production level security and reduce the level and of expertise that your developers and operators operators need and also what open ship provides is automated
00:23:09 [W] Would have root access and have somehow there's a security breach those types of containers can cause way more harm than non-privileged containers.
00:23:08 [W] So openshift is going to protect you in that way and also also try and deter you from running with the default namespace again that can cause some security issues as well.
00:23:18 [W] So a lot of tools to help you get up and running and provide production level security and reduce the level and of expertise that your developers and operators.
00:23:29 [W] Operators need and also what open ship provides is automated cluster size management.
00:23:35 [W] It'll automatically provision new worker nodes to increase the cluster size and it has great day to automated automated operation support So automated installation automated updates and cluster verdure version management.
00:23:48 [W] So a lot of features that that become very very valuable when you're ready to run in production, so obviously IBM has just standard kubernative Z
00:23:59 [W] And to open shift as Richard covered but those are the differences next chart.
00:24:07 [W] And so that pretty much concludes our presentation and we'd like to thank you for attending.
00:24:15 [W] Thank you.
00:25:02 [W] Production. So obviously IBM has just standard kubernative xan to open shift as Richard covered but those are the differences next chart.
00:25:15 [W] And so that pretty much concludes our presentation and we'd like to thank you for attending.
00:25:22 [W] Thank you.
00:26:14 [W] So we'll wait and see if any questions come in.
00:26:17 [W] Hopefully this this was helpful.
00:26:23 [W] We have one question.
00:26:27 [W] Oh, go ahead.
00:26:29 [W] Yeah, there's one question that did just came in here.
00:26:33 [W] So is red hat on IBM Cloud a new offering. So if we went back to that slide, it would have given you a timeline of when we delivered.
00:26:43 [W] The red hat IBM Cloud offering which is with our 3.11 release and I have to go and remind myself exactly when that was but it's been out there for quite a while.
00:26:55 [W] So I believe give me a moment I can get that answers when we delivered that.
00:27:05 [W] August 1st of 2019 is when we delivered 311 and rocks if you will red hat openshift on IBM cloud is our managed service.
00:27:17 [W] Good morning was the last you know Richard when the last update was done to the latest version of for the latest version of openshift.
00:27:25 [W] Yeah, we delivered four five on October 13th.
00:27:29 [W] Delivered that as soon as we can as well, I believe they delivered it end of October year.
00:27:38 [W] And then there's another question that just came in.
00:27:40 [W] What is the long-term supported version or openshift for da Dex?
00:27:47 [W] Am I understanding that it will be 4.6 and that they are planning to extend support for that and that may be replaced be as they go further on in the for DOT X releases that there may be a
00:28:02 [W] 11 for example that might be another one whereas longer term support is available through Red Hat event.
00:28:08 [W] As far as a managed service is concerned. We that would be a TBD exactly how we are going to do Mass the longer term support. But as you can see on our the previous slide, we did have a lot of longer term support plan for
00:28:23 [W] Just as openshift us.
00:28:22 [W] There's two more questions Richard one is does Rock support GPU enabled nodes.
00:28:29 [W] And I believe the answer is yes just a few days ago. I think or we're very close to it.
00:28:38 [W] I'll have to double check that though.
00:28:43 [W] And then another question was what would you say is the adoption rate of IBM cloud in general?
00:28:54 [W] Well, we've had very significant growth in our managed services for sure the last year year and a half I've ever seen I would say both on IKS and on rocks. So I think the adoption
00:29:09 [W] The buy into kubernative and openshift is value for businesses seems to resonate with a lot of folks.
00:29:12 [W] And I believe we're running tens of thousands of clusters and having to manage those with a very small team correct exactly exactly and in both of them being, you know, very well Richard platforms that you're
00:29:27 [W] Exactly exactly and and both of them being, you know, very well matured platforms that you're able to do that with smaller teams quite successfully. So there's been a lot of work,
00:29:35 [W] With smaller teams quite successfully. So there's been a lot of work, you know, if you look at the key customers, it's you know, you're looking at Airlines and car reservation systems and financial services
00:29:50 [W] Of customers that that that are using it sorry to with a big emphasis on the security that the platform provides is what they're looking for, but we do have but tremendous amount of automation that allows us
00:30:04 [W] Large number of clusters tens of thousands with remarkably small team that does does that.
00:30:20 [W] These are really good questions and any other questions from the audience.
00:30:33 [W] So does openshift I see another one does openshift provide security out of the box when compared to kubernative.
00:30:40 [W] So I think Brad you covered that really well at that last slide, but I think the key takeaway that I most people if you looked out of the box.
00:30:50 [W] Openshift is secure by default out of the box.
00:30:53 [W] Whereas if you look at kublr you can get it secure by default, but you got your thumb knobs to get there for sure, right?
00:31:01 [W] So, I'm sorry. I let me clarify that a bit because that's a great question.
00:31:04 [W] So out of the box openshift is doing things to help.
00:31:10 [W] give you some guardrails to help keep you from mistakenly configuring your your security or not not
00:31:20 [W] Configure your security and causing yourself a lot of harm and production.
00:31:25 [W] So let me examples.
00:31:29 [W] route out of the box if you
00:31:34 [W] And the reason is without you going through some really special extra Hoops to configure that because it is very there's a lot of extra surface area to attack when you run privilege containers.
00:31:48 [W] So openshift will prevent that from happening the other thing that's going to prevent out of the box that all of us who are just we did our development.
00:31:56 [W] We really just can't wait to get our container image into production and we didn't take the time to set up our own namespace.
00:32:03 [W] Is that we use the default namespace that's another example of something you would do maybe just with regular kubernative.
00:32:11 [W] He's but as you know, not a very good idea from a security perspective because again running and default the default namespace can allow a lot of security vulnerabilities.
00:32:21 [W] And then the third one that I like to point out is what are called the security context constraints when you try and do role-based access control with with with kubernative. There's so many knobs like
00:32:33 [W] Richard was saying you need to turn and you really need to make sure you got all that right and instead what openshift will provide you or these security profiles and you can just pick the profile.
00:32:44 [W] Any perspective because again running and default the default namespace can allow a lot of security vulnerabilities.
00:32:42 [W] And then the third one that I like to point out is what are called the security context constraints when you try and do role-based access control with with with kubernative.
00:32:54 [W] There's so many knobs like Richie was saying you need to turn and you really need to make sure you got all that right and instead what openshift will provide you are these security profiles and you can just pick the profile. That's the best.
00:33:06 [W] Pick and that security context constraint profile will set all those knobs the right way to give you the security you want because if you're just guessing turning all those knobs and that's what you're doing in production.
00:33:20 [W] you could be in for a really bad day.
00:33:27 [W] Richard did you want to take another question came in the major differences between 311 and openshift for docx?
00:33:33 [W] Sure.
00:33:34 [W] Yeah, that's a really good question.
00:33:37 [W] There's a lot of a lot of differences if you if you look at a what you get when you deliver a 311 cluster versus a for cluster.
00:33:46 [W] you're going to see a lot of operators in the for cluster that operate a deliver component. So they're like mini mini control planes if you will that save managed DNS or they manage the
00:34:01 [W] A what you get when you deliver a 311 cluster versus a for cluster, you're going to see a lot of operators in the for cluster that operate a deliver component. So they're like mini mini
00:34:18 [W] Proxy and you get a lot of those bits in a for cluster to be more automated for updates automated updates a little bit easier across the control Point.
00:34:30 [W] There's a lot more moving Parts a lot more feature set and you know that that from an operational standpoint.
00:34:38 [W] That's how I view it. I'm sure from an application Level. There's a ton of new features and and I couldn't couldn't begin to reach through all those
00:34:47 [W] Right, but let's go into a little more detail on the real big advantages of the four dot X, which is the day to the day two operations.
00:34:56 [W] So when you're actually running openshift, you get wonderful features like auto update and the auto-updates going to update not only the the operating system Rel underneath but also update the openshift so
00:35:11 [W] Together there's no conflicting versions.
00:35:13 [W] It'll also provide the ability to scale the cluster not just scale your app. But let's see how you know X number of worker nodes and it's not enough the openshift for DOT X out-of-the-box day two operations will enable
00:35:29 [W] that fashion so really where you see the advantages and a lot of this is built on the operator construct that Richard talked about there's an amazing amount of work that's been done to make running the for DOT X
00:35:35 [W] The four dot X day to operations very painless compared to the earlier versions.
00:35:44 [W] Okay, I think we're about out of time Richard.
00:35:47 [W] What do you think and on asada?
00:35:48 [W] Yeah, I think so.
00:35:50 [W] so. I agree.
00:35:52 [W] Fantastic questions.
00:35:54 [W] We really do appreciate it.
00:35:55 [W] Absolutely.
00:35:57 [W] All right.
00:36:00 [W] Thank you all for your time. Please go check it out.
00:36:05 [W] There's there's lots of opportunities to try out the managed openshift and kubernative service on IBM cloud and trials and what have you so please go check that all out sort of Richard want to wrap up.
00:36:18 [W] Yeah, definitely and to add onto that if you've tried out and you have any questions, we're on slack the kubernative select channel for provider IBM Cloud any time reaches there?
00:36:29 [W] Yep, absolutely.
00:36:30 [W] Thank you so much everyone.
00:36:32 [W] It's Richard said Brad said we are on slack mailing list.
00:36:36 [W] We have monthly meetings.
00:36:37 [W] So would love to have your participation that as well.
00:36:44 [W] All right.
00:36:45 [W] Thank you.
