00:00:00 [W] thinking about our container strategy how we enable our software developers to deliver software while meeting governance and Regulatory Compliance and ensuring that our container platforms can enable the developer experience to be
00:00:15 [W] Really really great without bogging them down with all of that overhead today.
00:00:20 [W] I'm going to share with you some of the lessons learned how we've achieved some of those goals and some open source offerings that we are bringing to the Greater Community.
00:00:31 [W] Let's get to it. If you're already here at Cube Khan, I probably don't need to tell you that kubernative has emerged as the most popular and widely leverage container management solution in recent years efficiently managing kubernative that scale.
00:00:47 [W] Especially at a highly regulated company may feel daunting.
00:00:51 [W] But it can be done.
00:00:54 [W] Today, I'm going to speak about how let me start by telling you a little bit about Capital One.
00:00:59 [W] We're 25 year old Fortune 100 company that is still founder LED when you think about Banks you probably don't expect that and this is one of the top things we hear from people about why they love to work at Capital One our founder LED startup mentality
00:01:14 [W] Leave you felt in everything we do we're doing things differently than other Banks banking is ripe for disruption. And we want to be the one that disrupt the industry Capital One was founded on the belief that the banking industry would be
00:01:28 [W] Mission and Technology, we are known for being a data and Tech Pioneer in the financial services industry two decades later.
00:01:33 [W] Our belief is stronger than ever and we are seeing the relevance of this Focus right now in the pandemic as businesses of all sizes grapple with how to engage customers at a distance through digital channels in the same human
00:01:49 [W] Analyze the ways they did before when we think about where the future of banking is headed.
00:01:53 [W] We start by looking at how technology is changing our lives. The digital revolution has changed how we communicate connect with people shop travel manage our health and manage. Our money digital adoption has only accelerated with covid-19.
00:02:08 [W] We've all seen years of digital adoption condensed down two months or even just weeks Capital One has spent the last eight years investing in a technology transformation focused on comprehensively reimagining our culture and talent
00:02:18 [W] Work and modernizing and hardening our technology infrastructure in September. We exited our Legacy data centers and finished moving to the cloud solidifying our foundation as the bank of the future in pioneering new standards tools and Technologies.
00:02:31 [W] We adopted an open source first approach to software development and infrastructure the most challenging part of moving to the cloud as a highly regulated industry is building the technology governance structure and support of culture on the technology side.
00:02:47 [W] Many financial institutions have structural barriers Legacy systems that have been in use for 20 years.
00:02:53 [W] Most banks don't have the technology in place to even send their code outside of the company's corporate firewall from the government's perspective.
00:03:02 [W] It takes time to develop a process where code is reviewed by Legal Information Security and Leadership along with other stakeholders without impacting the developers themselves all that much and culturally traditional Banks need to chatbots.
00:03:17 [W] owners of perceived risks such as loss of intellectual property competitiveness or productivity a huge part of us going all in on the cloud and digital transformation is investing in our Tech Associates and giving them the tools they need to excel we
00:03:32 [W] And we believe in continuously investing in them. One way we invest is to constantly encourage continued learning to that end.
00:03:36 [W] We launched a Tech College inside of Capital One to support Associates ability to sharpen their skills.
00:03:42 [W] Our Focus areas include software engineering security Cloud mobile data agile and machine learning in addition to hard skills Tech College provides training around soft skills as well as they can be just as important
00:03:57 [W] Have ambitious goals around training and certifications.
00:03:53 [W] For example, we have aspirational targets for the number of Engineers who will get AWS certifications and we're giving Associates time to study over the course of the summer and into the fall.
00:04:04 [W] We've had a series of invest in yourself days one day a month where there are no meetings allowing time to focus. We've had numerous certifications completed over the past several months as a result of the program an unforeseen side effect with our gradual approach the cloud
00:04:19 [W] Duplication of efforts when you really embrace the cloud Intel developers who are organized into independent agile teams to go make stuff happen. You get various iterations on similar Solutions a large amount of duplication many of these teams were used to
00:04:29 [W] growing Solutions over the wall for someone else to run and yet now they had to own things and to end we quickly realized we quickly realized that a you go that you own it mandate and doubling down on devops was the key to keeping delivery Rapid, but
00:04:42 [W] At the same time re-architecting our process in this way has allowed us to successfully and efficiently deliver Solutions in the cloud another best practice.
00:04:51 [W] I can share in this area is investing in creating a single common deployment pipeline ecosystem that allows us to build consistent checks and expectations for getting code into production.
00:05:00 [W] We built the solution to address a gap in the industry and we're already seeing the benefits of more efficient delivery.
00:05:07 [W] We've applied similar thinking to our container management strategy in recent years.
00:05:11 [W] We've scaled our usage of kubernative and steadily increase the number of containerized applications.
00:05:16 [W] We have running production harkening back to some of our earlier lessons learned from our Cloud Journey.
00:05:20 [W] We knew we wanted to avoid Silo teams creating disparate solutions to manage their own containerized applications instead.
00:05:27 [W] We decided we needed to standardize on our own set of additional features across the company that would enable our developers to more efficiently develop and deliver.
00:05:37 [W] Business value this meant running kubernative.
00:05:40 [W] He's at Enterprise scale in a regulated environment earlier this year.
00:05:45 [W] We commissioned a study with forest or Consulting about container adoption and usage in the enterprise.
00:05:50 [W] We found that compliance is the number one concern among senior leaders using container management platforms for this reason.
00:05:57 [W] It might surprise you to hear that a bank was an early adopter of kubenetes.
00:06:00 [W] We fully embrace the technology in 2016 less than two years after its initial release kubenetes is certainly newer.
00:06:06 [W] solutions to manage their own containerized applications instead we decided we needed to standardize on our own set of additional features across the company that would enable our developers to more efficiently develop and deliver business value
00:07:34 [W] doesn't make it inherently insecure for many companies fear of introducing new risks can make them feel lost when it comes to exploring and adopting new technologies compliance and safety is what people really care about across most
00:07:50 [W] Regulated ones in many cases understanding all of the factors.
00:07:54 [W] you need to evaluate as you build a container management platform is a challenge in and of itself we found it was helpful to consider our overall Cloud strategy our culture and talent strategy the state of our Cloud resources where they ever provisioned
00:08:09 [W] And development speed and scaling requirements other important components of a successful container management strategy include that supply chain how your containers are built where they are stored how they're validated the infrastructure and orchestration where and how your containers are
00:08:21 [W] On together how they can access each other the runtime security and policy enforcement how you ensure your containers do what you want and nothing else and observability runtime metrics debugging audit logging tracing everything
00:08:34 [W] To run your containers in a well-managed way.
00:08:36 [W] There are many benefits to a container orchestration platform developers can focus on business outcomes logging in metric Gathering can be for free compliance and government are baked in by default.
00:08:47 [W] You can have a testable workloads better infrastructure utilization and you can have higher resiliency.
00:08:53 [W] simply put a container orchestration platform should meet the needs of your developers as well as your Enterprise developers need a simplified inconsistent workflow with an intuitive interface.
00:09:03 [W] Face that will put deployed applications at their fingertips for quick and efficient management.
00:09:07 [W] The platform should be flexible to develop and deploy applications to while giving freedom to write code and not have to manage that infrastructure Enterprises need compliance and Regulatory Control Plus the ability to enforce workflow standardization and
00:09:22 [W] City placed upon developers when we start thinking about how we begin to meet these goals and Achieve those benefits it leads us to the makeup of the platform and the components of it two of these components.
00:09:35 [W] We've already open sourced each solved some challenges. We encountered around provisioning and resiliency of kubernative clusters crit is a command line bootstrapper for kubenetes, which decouples management of at CD enables multiple nodes to be provision
00:09:50 [W] Correctly regardless of the order in which they come up and is designed to work with the cluster API.
00:09:51 [W] We open sourced crits in September of this year e to D is a tool for deploying fully automated at CD clusters at CD the powerful back-end storage that makes software that kubernative possible has historically required a human operator to perform
00:10:07 [W] It of tasks like initial cluster bootstrapping cluster membership data backups and Disaster Recovery e2d solves for many of those challenges that we came across crits and E to D are both part of critical stackrox container
00:10:17 [W] It runs on top of kubenetes critical stackin forces common governance and security controls enabling teams to efficiently scale containerized applications in the strictest of environments for developers critical stakus full of valuable functionality
00:10:30 [W] of environments for developers critical stakus full of valuable functionality stackables is a path to enable packaging of applications in a way which takes into account all of the kubernative objects, which are needed this creates an immutable
00:10:43 [W] Package, which can be promoted from one environment to another having a running platform.
00:10:48 [W] That is a default location for workloads means we shift left the whole you build it.
00:10:54 [W] you own it portion of things swol provides e b PF metrics Gathering and tracing for all kubernative workloads enabling Engineers to truly understand the impact of their workloads on the underlying infrastructure.
00:11:07 [W] There's also a developer UI which provides fingertip access to your name spaces containers, Lon.
00:11:13 [W] Boggs traces and an editor with templates to help ease the learning curve of kubernative for the Enterprise and platform operators.
00:11:22 [W] There's a bunch as well.
00:11:23 [W] There's a user interface which provides enhanced our back management SSO integration along with audit logging by default psyllium cni-genie is installed as part of the critical stackprof form by default along with the ability to edit policies all within
00:11:38 [W] This gives you multiple layers of network filtering capacity.
00:11:41 [W] There's also a Marketplace enabling approved Helm Registries and selectively approved charts for simple single button deployments into namespaces.
00:11:51 [W] We are excited to announce today that critical stakus open source.
00:11:55 [W] We'd love for you to check us out on GitHub and see how we can help you and your teams with safe scalable and efficient container management. Thank you for having me here today. And please enjoy the rest of the conference.
