00:00:00 [W] Our job is to make kubernative easier and easier and easier to use either from an Ops point of view or developer point of view while acknowledging it is complex because we're solving a complex problem.
00:01:10 [W] Kubernative will be boring as soon as we can make it boring.
00:01:14 [W] It's already boring.
00:01:15 [W] So I think we're well on our journey towards kubernative being boring.
00:01:19 [W] It'll only be boring when it's done.
00:01:21 [W] It'll only be done when it's no longer relevant.

01:31:26 [W1] Before we start our programming today.
01:31:29 [W1] I would like to play this message from Jim's emlyn the executive director of the Linux Foundation about cncf longtime leader Dan Khan who recently passed away due to complications from colon cancer.
01:31:49 [W1] You know 2020 has been a very tough year and you know Dan was as all of you know from this community Forever The Optimist and Problem Solver when he was diagnosed.
01:32:03 [W1] He sought to defy the odds and fight this disease as long as he could sadly and very suddenly things took a turn for the worse and Dan did succumb to his illness in a short time.
01:32:16 [W1] You know Dan played a special role at the foundation his impact far exceeded his time with us.
01:32:23 [W1] He helped establish the organization we are today and he oversaw the fastest-growing open source community in history your community the cloud native Computing Foundation.
01:32:37 [W1] Dan was also a Pioneer in 1994.
01:32:41 [W1] Something all of us use almost every day.
01:32:45 [W1] Dan was opinionated.
01:32:46 [W1] He never strayed from a debate via email or in person, you know, I love to go to dinners with Dan because I knew the conversation would always be interesting and I wouldn't have to say a word.
01:33:01 [W1] Does that sound familiar to anybody you know in the open source community?
01:33:06 [W1] Indeed it does because Dan was one of you and we're lucky to spend time with him.
01:33:15 [W1] What you may not know about Dan was his lifelong desire to help others.
01:33:21 [W1] From serving as a volunteer firefighter in college to his constant advocacy to encourage diversity in the cncf community and an open source in general to stepping aside from his role in
01:33:36 [W1] Foundation to incubate and found the Linux Foundation Public Health Initiative, which is helping Public Health authorities around the world combat covid-19.
01:33:34 [W1] Dan could always be counted on to help in a crisis.
01:33:39 [W1] Initial reactions to his death from members of our community and many of you are full of statements Dan help me paired with a life or career changing impact many of us
01:33:55 [W1] Members of our community and many of you are full of statements Dan help me paired with a life or career changing impact many of us benefited directly from Dan's generosity of time
01:34:07 [W1] from Dan's generosity of time and thoughtfulness
01:34:13 [W1] Dan leaves behind his wife Julie and two young boys Adam and Ellis whom he loved dearly and many of you probably met at one of the many cncf events around the world.
01:34:28 [W1] This even more tragic is that Dan himself lost both his parents at roughly the same age as his boys are today to the AIDS pandemic.
01:34:38 [W1] This is why our Public Health effort was so important to him personally.
01:34:46 [W1] I was able to spend some time with Dan the week he passed and he wanted me to tell all of you how much he loved working with everyone in the open source community.
01:35:00 [W1] He was truly proud to have had the opportunity to help impact so many lives through his work and friendships in your world.
01:35:12 [W1] You know.
01:35:14 [W1] Today, it seems like the world is sick from so many things.
01:35:21 [W1] And while Dan didn't succeed in defeating his illness it was his wish that we carry on in the spirit of collaboration and generosity in establishing the Linux Foundation
01:35:36 [W1] As a shared resource not just to fight the covid-19 pandemic but to combat Future Health crisis.
01:35:45 [W1] In the end Dan wanted us all to see beyond each other's weaknesses and to work together in the spirit of love and kindness.
01:35:58 [W1] And we will honor his legacy by doing just that.
01:36:03 [W1] Not only in public health, but in all the important work all of you do together in open source.
01:36:13 [W1] We would like to support his family in this time of loss and secure a future for his boys college education.
01:36:21 [W1] For those of you who can contribute we've set up a site that you can contribute to the Dan con family education trust through the URL.
01:36:33 [W1] You see on your screen right now.
01:36:37 [W1] If you'd never rather not donate through that option A Family Trust is being set up that you would be able to contribute to directly and you can email the Linux Foundation to find out how to contribute there as well.
01:36:52 [W1] We encourage everybody to consider thanking Dan for his contributions by supporting his family.
01:37:01 [W1] I want to thank all of you so much.
01:37:03 [W1] this Stan
01:36:56 [W1] and on his behalf.
01:36:57 [W1] I want to express how much he cared for each and every one of you.
01:37:05 [W1] Thank you.
01:37:06 [W1] Good morning, Barcelona.
01:37:17 [W1] My name is Dan Khan and I am executive director of the cloud native Computing Foundation.
01:38:20 [W1] In the work that we're doing here together this week building on top of the shoulders of giants. Maybe neither Swift nor easy, but is also laying the foundations of the next generation of Innovations, which are even now being
01:38:35 [W1] half of kubernative
01:38:43 [W1] Thank you very much.
01:38:56 [W1] What an amazing tribute for an amazing man?
01:39:16 [W1] Hello, everyone. Welcome to coupon Cloud native con North America.
01:39:22 [W1] I'm Priyanka Sharma and I'm the general manager of the cloud native Computing Foundation.
01:39:28 [W1] It is my great pleasure to welcome you here Dan built this amazing ecosystem with all of us.
01:39:37 [W1] where the story of Team Cloud native a story of diversity powered resilience
01:39:43 [W1] And it is this diversity that makes us more resilient to weather any challenge.
01:39:46 [W1] Even the loss of a great leader.
01:39:50 [W1] As Dan grew this community diversity was at the Cornerstone of everything he built he changed the face of what tech conferences look like with inspirational coupon chairs and attendees from all kinds of backgrounds.
01:40:03 [W1] Just like all of you under his leadership and users became an official part of our ecosystem and we became a global movement.
01:40:15 [W1] Dance contribution to our world are many and to borrow from a well-known quote.
01:40:20 [W1] Dan was the man in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs who comes short again and again because there is no effort without error
01:40:35 [W1] Coming but who does actually strive to do the Deeds who knows great enthusiasms the great devotions who spends himself in a worthy cause who at best knows in the end the Triumph
01:40:49 [W1] Achievement and who at worst if he fails at least fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid Souls who neither know Victory nor defeat.
01:40:56 [W1] That is the standard dance at for us and we will not let him down.
01:41:01 [W1] team Cloud native I say we are the ones in the arena we will fight on and keep building the technology the community and the stories that Dan laid the foundation for
01:41:14 [W1] 2020 has thrown a lot at us.
01:41:17 [W1] But these are the kind of challenges that open source and Cloud native were built for our resilience comes from are far-reaching diverse Community. Dan worked tirelessly to diversify not only our
01:41:32 [W1] the den lead the foundation for
01:41:34 [W1] 2020 has thrown a lot at us.
01:41:36 [W1] But these are the kind of challenges that open source and Cloud native were built for our resilience comes from are far-reaching diverse Community. Dan worked tirelessly to diversify not only our
01:42:08 [W1] But also our Geographic reach and the end users we so who in turn Dutch hundreds of millions of consumers with their products and services.
01:42:19 [W1] It is my commitment to you that we will double down on those efforts those efforts to innovate more faster better by unleashing and enabling the power of a diverse Foundation of doors.
01:42:34 [W1] In order to do so we need to hold ourselves to the highest standards of inclusion.
01:42:41 [W1] Unfortunately, our ethos is not always reflected in our code.
01:42:47 [W1] To date offensive terminology such as Master Slave and whitelist Blacklist exists in our code bases the kubernative community recognized this and has already made big changes.
01:43:02 [W1] Building upon their work in the kubernative naming working group and partnering with industry France such as IBM and red hat and many others. We have kicked off across organizational corroboration focused on inclusive naming in
01:43:17 [W1] The goal of the initiative is to help motivated projects and organizations to effectively change manage to better terminology.
01:43:28 [W1] When it comes to diversity and inclusion open source has broken the barriers we call borders.
01:43:35 [W1] The cloud native Community is no exception Dan after all right Cube, gone2asia pack and under his leadership cncf welcomed both members and projects from the region.
01:43:47 [W1] Today, I am thrilled to welcome volcano engine by byte dance a global company based in China to cncf as a platinum member.
01:43:57 [W1] Let's learn more about them from their VP doctors.
01:44:02 [W1] Jinjiang joining us from Beijing. Machina engine is an Enterprise class service platform lunch by the Chinese technology company by dance. We have more than
01:44:17 [W1] than employees across a hundred and fifty countries are apps including the total content platform and the dough in video sharing social network support 75 different languages and our amount the most popular in
01:44:32 [W1] - of countries we have been a very heavy user of clown 80s knowledge is for a long time violence for example uses containers to manage half a million physical machines across tens of data centers.
01:44:34 [W1] All of our apps have been built on top of microservices and servicemeshcon deeply know the value of cloudevents acknowledge. He's in a secondly part of vicuna engine strategy is to place a lot of emphasis
01:44:49 [W1] Developer echo system and a community. We want to open source our own Technologies around things like clown ATIV storage and a cloud native machine learning.
01:44:48 [W1] We want to impact the developer community and a cncf is one of the top communities in this domain.
01:44:56 [W1] So that's the right channel to draw.
01:44:59 [W1] I definitely agree with that. Thank you for joining us June.
01:45:06 [W1] Asia is not the only place in brazing Cloud native.
01:45:10 [W1] The Passion of our community connects dots across many parts of the globe take for instance Kasten a start-up in the San Francisco Bay area that was recently acquired by VM and international company in the data protection
01:45:25 [W1] So that's the right channel to draw.
01:45:20 [W1] I definitely agree with that. Thank you for joining us June.
01:45:27 [W1] Asia is not the only place embracing Cloud native.
01:45:31 [W1] The Passion of our community connects dots across many parts of the globe take for instance Kasten a start-up in the San Francisco Bay area that was recently acquired by VM and international company in the data production space.
01:46:31 [W1] The US and Switzerland today, they are upgrading to a platinum membership their general manager nearish. Talia has joined me here today.
01:46:41 [W1] Let's learn from him about why Kasten by VM is doubling down on cncf of you who don't already know us Gaston is the market leader for kubernative data management.
01:46:53 [W1] We make it very easy for more developers and operators to run stateful qualitative applications by providing a powerful kubernative knative.
01:47:01 [W1] The platform for backup disaster recovery and cross cluster and cross Cloud application were billeted. The recently. We were a startup that in fact emerge from stuff that who conned in 2017 given what we owe to this community increasing our support for cncf.
01:47:16 [W1] After a recent acquisition by me as an extremely important with easy decision to make and also shows the commitment to the broader ecosystem looking forward as exciting as things are today.
01:47:27 [W1] I believe that we still have a great in front of us.
01:47:30 [W1] I remember my first group called Seattle in 2016.
01:47:33 [W1] And even though cloudevents Knology adoption is taken of that. He sticks instead.
01:47:38 [W1] We will look back at the news very fond memories of what will still feel like the early days.
01:47:44 [W1] Given how important developers and big application Centric is to everything that we do at Kasten.
01:47:50 [W1] I'm also looking forward to seeing the team for engage even further with both the community and cncf during this period of upcoming growth to everyone out there. Thank you so much for having us.
01:48:02 [W1] Thank you for your support neeraj.
01:48:05 [W1] As gin and neeraja have shared these new memberships are in a march to our community our technology and its promise for end-users.
01:48:15 [W1] This ecosystem is so Diversified after all we built the ship on kubernative and its success enabled knative manded a constellation of projects to support modernizing applications.
01:48:31 [W1] This ecosystem is so Diversified after all we built the ship on kubernative and its success enabled knative manded a constellation of projects to support modernizing applications.
01:48:46 [W1] Today many of our 70 plus projects are used in tandem by our end users to meet their diverse Cloud native needs for example cncf host the vitess project, which is a database clustering system for
01:49:10 [W1] my SQL
01:49:12 [W1] and use a company HubSpot uses vitess to run a hundred percent off their my SQL clusters on top of kubernative processing a hundred plus terabytes of data.
01:49:26 [W1] Another end-user company pay it provides a digital platform for government agencies think digital DMV after adopting kubernative Prometheus Envoy and fluent e paid reduce their infrastructure
01:49:41 [W1] and percent of Revenue
01:49:43 [W1] that is cloud native at its finest as you can see our end users are changing the world.
01:49:51 [W1] And many of you are sitting in the audience in your own homes today.
01:49:56 [W1] That's why and user-driven open source is so inspiring today workloads are run at a scale never seen before managing complexity.
01:50:07 [W1] None of us has ever experienced establishing a direct feedback loop between our end users and projects has been invaluable and further diversifies team Cloud native. We thank you and users for taking the
01:50:21 [W1] Time and effort and we promise to continue to build and user-driven open source here in Cloud native with you.
01:50:29 [W1] And as you have told us security concerns rise to the top of the metaphorical stack as you bring Cloud native Pilots to production fear not team Cloud native is here to support earlier this year.
01:50:43 [W1] We announced a new certification certified kubernative security specialist or cks.
01:50:49 [W1] The cks is a performance-based exam today.
01:50:53 [W1] I'm excited to announce that registration for cks is officially open. If you're an end-user company, this certification will help you train and certify your developers for the working knowledge of container security.
01:51:07 [W1] Ready concerns rise to the top of the metaphorical stack as you bring Cloud native Pilots to production fear. Not team Cloud native is here to support earlier this year.
01:51:14 [W1] We announced a new certification certified kubernative security specialist or cks. The cks is a performance-based exam today.
01:51:24 [W1] I'm excited to announce that registration for cks is officially open.
01:51:29 [W1] If you're an end-user company, this certification will help you train and certify your developers with a working knowledge of container security.
01:51:39 [W1] I encourage you to invest in your developers and support their Journey from devops to Dub Sack ups with the cks resilience comes in many forms diversifying skill sets is one of them.
01:51:54 [W1] Finally, let's talk about a diversity not often discussed that of workloads different verticals have unique requirements and as the cloud native ecosystem has matured it is now positioned to address these needs.
01:52:09 [W1] Two of the most demanding verticals that are also critical to our lives are Telco. S' and Edge Computing the cloud native ecosystem has kicked off a cloud native Network function working group to Define Telco workloads
01:52:24 [W1] Different verticals have unique requirements and as the cloud native ecosystem has matured it is now positioned to address these needs.
01:52:33 [W1] Two of the most demanding verticals that are also critical to our lives our Telco s' and Edge computing.
01:52:41 [W1] The cloud native ecosystem has kicked off Cloud native Network function working group to Define Telco workloads based on kubernative.
01:52:51 [W1] If this is something you care about please attend our CNF working group kickoff on Thursday to learn more and participate.
01:53:00 [W1] On The Edge front I'm excited to announce that Cox Communications shares our vision of bringing Cloud native to the edge and is joining the cncf as a gold member Cox is the largest private Broadband company
01:53:15 [W1] Serving homes and businesses with critical connectivity and solutions.
01:53:21 [W1] Cox is investing in educator abilities and looks forward to partnering with developers across the ecosystem in delivering cloud services and low latency performance to their residential and business customers.
01:53:34 [W1] We are thrilled to have them on board as a member and look forward to working with them in the coming year.
01:53:42 [W1] When I think about all of this great work, I've been with pride pride at all of our efforts Pride at the resilience. We have shown in this challenging year.
01:53:55 [W1] In all of the tributes, I read about Dan everyone shared how kind and caring he was and I experienced the same with him.
01:54:05 [W1] He was a Visionary with a gentle soul.
01:54:07 [W1] Someone who always wanted to see how he could help improve the lives of others.
01:54:14 [W1] Let's live our lives by his example.
01:54:18 [W1] Let's find the time to say hello to someone who may be churning out PRS and could use a break.
01:54:25 [W1] Let's reach out to someone who may have gone dark and see if they need a helping hand.
01:54:30 [W1] How kind and caring he was and I experienced the same with him.
01:54:30 [W1] He was a Visionary with a gentle soul.

01:54:50 [W1] Let's reach out to someone who may have gone dark and see if they need a helping hand.
01:54:56 [W1] I don't want anyone to ever doubt even for a minute that there is a place for them here in team Cloud near the answer is always yes, because diversity powered resilience is what
01:55:42 [W1] Is what open source and Cloud native are all about the webinar live us inclusive connected and stronger because of it.
01:55:52 [W1] Resilience is built not born our open source way of doing.
01:56:15 [W1] Will build ever more resilience in our companies in our organizations in our society. We are on the brink of change across borders and certainly in the United States.
01:56:28 [W1] Our diversity our openness. Our differences will power.
01:56:37 [W1] Untold Innovation Innovation that matters Innovation that makes end-users more efficient productive and creative and Innovation that ultimately adds value to the life of every single human being
01:56:54 [W1] Team Cloud native dancer has on the staff and now it's on us.
01:56:59 [W1] I say to you today make the most of Kube con Cloud knative coins, and this amazing community that is gathered here. Go engage with each other learn from the sessions be inspired and go do great things.
01:57:13 [W1] Innovation that matters Innovation that makes end users more efficient productive and creative and Innovation that ultimately adds value to the life of every single human being team
01:58:26 [W1] Hey, so my last conversation with Dan was actually around joining as a cube conch are and whether or not I'd be up for it.
01:58:37 [W1] And I think that you know overall just thinking about all of the things that have been said about Dan about the community about what he has started and what we continue to carry forward is huge.
01:58:52 [W1] The the impact that was made and the opportunities that have been given to so many people in the cloud native space to do great work and to get together and deliver and just be a cloud native family.
01:59:06 [W1] think is what is what Rings true out of out of everything, you know for me. I'm going to going to the memorial and just hearing everything the Dan has been a part of makes me think about like how we can
01:59:22 [W1] How we can think bigger right?
01:59:24 [W1] I feel like I'm just getting started in terms of like thinking big and learning how to lead.
01:59:30 [W1] So so I think that's what I take away from his his legacy trying to be better trying to deliver you a great conference trying to to do to do better for everyone.
01:59:42 [W1] So, thank you Steven.
01:59:49 [W1] Yeah, I think.
01:59:52 [W1] If you know me, I'm not really good on my feet.
01:59:54 [W1] And so I'll be definitely paraphrasing a lot of people said but
02:00:01 [W1] alright this pretty much sort of say like thank you Dan for getting us here and like for planting the seeds for where we can locally won't go and that
02:00:16 [W1] You Steven?
02:00:15 [W1] Yeah, I think.
02:00:18 [W1] If you know me, I'm not really good on my feet.
02:00:20 [W1] And so I'll be definitely paraphrasing a lot of people said but
02:00:27 [W1] right this pretty much sort of say like thank you Dan for getting us here and like for planting the seeds for where we can locally will go and
02:00:40 [W1] that
02:00:42 [W1] you know, it's like it's our homework and you know should be your takeaway is that we should all try to emulate, you know, his kindness his compassion and you know his energy and values to continue to make this community, you know to continue to
02:01:00 [W1] it's our homework and you know should be your takeaways that we should all try to emulate, you know, his kindness is compassion and you know his energy and values to continue to make this community, you know to continue to grow this community because
02:01:15 [W1] Testament to over the past few years I Austin was my first conference and I think I was like two 4,000 people and if this were to be in person who had been meant for what we're estimating almost 15,000 people read That's and that's just in person, right?
02:01:30 [W1] Showing how much is community is grown is direct, you know is from Dan's hard work and so we should all continue to emulate his energy and values and thank you Dan for everything you've done for me personally and for the community.
02:01:47 [W1] So our next presenter is is Cheryl hung Cheryl's a director of ecosystem at the cloud native Computing foundation. And today she's going to give you some updates on the cncf end-user ecosystem, please welcome Cheryl hung.
02:02:13 [W1] Hi everyone, and welcome to keep calm Cloud native calm.
02:02:16 [W1] This is Cheryl hung and I'm very excited to be joining you here from my kitchen.
02:02:23 [W1] She's going to give you some updates on the cncf end user ecosystem, please welcome Cheryl hung.
02:02:41 [W1] Hi everyone, and welcome to keep calm Cloud native calm.
02:02:44 [W1] This is Cheryl hung and I'm very excited to be joining you here from my kitchen.
02:02:57 [W1] But there's somebody who should be here and who isn't and that's Dan Kohn my previous manager one of the founders and executive director of the cncf when I recorded my keynote a few weeks ago.
02:03:11 [W1] None of us knew that he was going to leave us so soon.
02:03:14 [W1] So I wanted to share memory with you first and that's the very first
02:03:58 [W1] Hi everyone, and welcome to keep calm Cloud native come this is Cheryl hung and I'm very excited to be joining you here from my kitchen.
02:04:08 [W1] But there's somebody who should be here and who isn't and that's Dan Kohn my previous manager one of the founders and executive director of the cncf when I recorded my keynote a few weeks ago.
02:04:21 [W1] None of us knew that he was going to leave us so soon.
02:04:25 [W1] So I wanted to share memory with you first and that's the very first time that I spoke to Dan while I was interviewing for cncf.
02:04:34 [W1] But there's somebody who should be here and who isn't and that's done cone.
02:04:39 [W1] my previous manager one of the founders and executive director of the cncf when I recorded my keynote a few weeks ago. None of us knew that he was going to leave us so soon. So I wanted to share memory with you first
02:05:03 [W1] And then he when he picked up the phone to me.
02:05:06 [W1] The first thing he said to me was Cheryl.
02:05:11 [W1] After cncf, you could become the executive director of your own Foundation or you could start a start-up or you could become a VC or you could join one of our member companies and I was so surprised because I was like, aren't I
02:05:26 [W1] You why I'm good enough to do this job.
02:05:28 [W1] Why are you talking about?
02:05:29 [W1] What should happen after I do cncf, but that's how he thought about people and that's how he thought about the community.
02:05:37 [W1] It was never about.
02:05:38 [W1] Are you good enough to do it today?
02:05:41 [W1] He was always about how can I set you up so that in the future you'll be even better and you'll have even more opportunities to do what you want to do for that.
02:05:50 [W1] I'm very grateful and I know many of you who knew Dan are also very grateful.
02:05:57 [W1] And in the spirit of that I'm going to spend the rest of my keynote talking about the training and certification and education upskilling yourself and your team's but I just wanted to say thank you Dan we all miss you.
02:06:19 [W1] Hello everyone and welcome to keep Concord knative Khan.
02:06:22 [W1] I'm Cheryl and I've got two really exciting announcements from cncf certification. One is a new certified kubernative security Specialists. And the second is new training benefits for end user companies.
02:06:35 [W1] All Cube con attendees get a discount on certifications.
02:06:39 [W1] So I wanted to help you understand whether you should spend your time getting certified. Let's talk about
02:06:46 [W1] Three questions who should take certifications?
02:06:50 [W1] What do they cover?
02:06:51 [W1] First who should take certifications certifications are good for many different audiences. According to the 2020 open source jobs reports fund. The Linux Foundation devops is the most sought-after job
02:07:03 [W1] A five percent of companies looking to hire more devops talent and the average salary for a kubernative job in the u.s. Is a hundred and forty eight thousand dollars.
02:07:00 [W1] We've got over 19. Everyone has way more time at home than normal and we have seen incredible growth incredible demand for training and certification 68% of professionals told us that they plan to
02:07:15 [W1] This year which is up significantly from 47 percent in 2018.
02:07:19 [W1] For hiring managers, obviously a certification is not the same as real world experience.
02:07:24 [W1] I definitely know this because when I was a devops manager back in 2017, it was just basically impossible to find anyone with experience running kubernative in production.
02:07:37 [W1] So doing interviews, I would you know, look for cloud native mindset that says person think about releasing frequently.
02:07:43 [W1] Do they think about monitoring their life systems do they think about automation?
02:07:49 [W1] Remember had one really memorable answer to this one candidate said we build our software using containers and Jenkins.
02:07:57 [W1] Okay, all sounds pretty good so far and then we burn our software to DVDs and we ship those DVDs out and I just had this mind-blowing moment because while we have come a long way
02:08:13 [W1] Shipping DVDs through the mail to what people expect nowadays from software and a huge part of that is thanks to the many contributors who have put their time into Cloud native projects a third audience for certification.
02:08:25 [W1] Cloud native projects a third audience for certifications is end users those who are adopting kubenetes and they want to establish a baseline of knowledge across existing teams 74% of hiring managers
02:08:33 [W1] What would need to pay for certifications and one told me we chose to pursue the CK and cked training classes as a way to provide an educational foundation for wide swath of software and platform engineer's
02:08:48 [W1] kubenetes, and is ecosystem
02:08:50 [W1] Kubernative is our main infrastructure platform, and we wanted to set up a kubernative baseline of knowledge for SRE and application engineers.
02:08:59 [W1] And we chose CK and CKD as a community validated approach.
02:09:04 [W1] So what at second question, what do the certifications cover CK a stands for certified kubernative administrator and CKD for certified kubenetes application developer and we
02:09:19 [W1] It to launch the third in the series that is the C KS or certified kubenetes security specialist and it's going to cover six topics cluster set up cost a hardening system hardening minimizing
02:09:33 [W1] Supply chain security monitoring logging and runtime security, but where did these six topics come from?
02:09:36 [W1] So let me tell you this is John Foreman.
02:09:40 [W1] He is a senior technical architecture manager at Accenture and over the last two years.
02:09:45 [W1] He had seen a shift in client questions from what our containers to how do we secure containers and to him that disconnect was because current security tools were not
02:09:58 [W1] Nowhere, so although teams were good at monitoring servers operating systems and network layers.
02:10:04 [W1] The container clusters just consistently went unmonitored.
02:10:08 [W1] So John and his team had been working on this container security reference model for Dev seccomp engineer's which he wanted to share out with the rest of the community.
02:10:19 [W1] So John and I we had a coffee and Q concern Diego and he asked whether cncf would create a new security Focus.
02:10:27 [W1] Ian which would be the gold standard for when companies hire Talent OR encourage their current staff to get certified and I said, yeah, that sounds great because I've also seen the same growing demand for container security
02:10:43 [W1] Open source jobs report degrees after Cloud Technologies and Linux security is the third highest priority knowledge area, but this certification has to be community-driven because it has to reflect security practices across
02:10:57 [W1] please so thanks to Sig security 20 Security Experts from vendors consultancies and end-users volunteer to come together and they discuss the most important tasks that a security specialist
02:11:01 [W1] And that's where these six topics came from and I want to say a huge.
02:11:05 [W1] thank you to John his team and our Security Experts for contributing your time and your expertise to the community because to answer the question of what do certifications cover its the community duh the
02:11:20 [W1] Is decides what is most important last question?
02:11:22 [W1] Is this a fair test?
02:11:24 [W1] And do you need real skills to pass it?
02:11:26 [W1] Well, there's only one way to find out.
02:11:28 [W1] I think I'm going to go and try it myself.
02:11:31 [W1] So let's go over to a laptop.
02:11:36 [W1] Alright, so the first thing that I see here is that it's not QA.
02:11:42 [W1] I actually have a live cluster and a live terminal that I can type into so I'm told that I need to set the configuration context before I start.
02:11:50 [W1] I'm just going to copy and paste that looks like I can switch to the kubernetes context and I am given a task here.
02:11:59 [W1] So my task is to find the pods running on any nodes having a memory limit configured and write the name of
02:12:06 [W1] Pollard with the highest memory limit configured to this file / up / whatever whatever. So my first task I'm going to look at the cluster and look at the nodes with Cube CTL get nodes.
02:12:23 [W1] It's like this is a three node cluster.
02:12:25 [W1] I have kubernative Master zero kubernative node 0 and kubernative Node 1 the next step for me.
02:12:33 [W1] me I think is to look for the pods that are running on each node.
02:12:38 [W1] I'm actually going to pause here and ask what would you do and we'll come back to this solution at the end.
02:12:45 [W1] Configured to this file / up, / whatever whatever. So my first task I'm going to look at the cluster and look at the nodes with Cube CTL get nodes.
02:12:57 [W1] It's like this is a three node cluster.
02:12:59 [W1] I have kubernative Master zuo kubernative node 0 and kubenetes Node 1. The next step for me. I think is to look for the pods that are running on each node.
02:13:12 [W1] I'm actually going to pause here and ask what would you do and we'll come back to this solution at the end.
02:13:21 [W1] So to me, I actually do feel like this is a fair test because you have to be comfortable with a command line with Cube CTL and other tools that are sysadmin would typically use over 15,000 people who have already completed the cka or CKD.
02:13:50 [W1] Me I actually do feel like this is a fair test because you have to be comfortable with a command line with Cube CTL and other tools that are sysadmin would typically use over 15,000 people who have already completed the cka or CKD
02:14:11 [W1] People ugly.
02:14:12 [W1] It's pretty hard one.
02:14:43 [W1] Said we think specifications really valuable and I'll Engineers found the training and exam approach fair and practical as its Performance Based not theoretical so to sum up is it worth getting a certification?
02:14:59 [W1] The company said it best no training is perfect.
02:15:01 [W1] It's not going to make an engineer an expert after 1 week of training but the Hands-On exercises help build muscle memory, which engineer's can leverage in their day-to-day responsibilities, and we want to encourage more people to get certified.
02:15:17 [W1] so all que con attendees get 50% off if you register this week making it $150 instead of $300 and I'm personally really excited to announce new training benefits for end users if your
02:15:26 [W1] Upton kubenetes and you plan to certify a whole team you should join cncf as an end-user member because you're going to get an unlimited training subscription for 15 users +15 exam vouchers for value of up
02:15:35 [W1] Dollars or you can join as an end-user supporter and get 5 training courses or certifications for value of up to $2,500.
02:15:43 [W1] So if you're currently adopting kubernative and you want to improve the training and education options for your team go to cncf dot IO / join.
02:15:55 [W1] Last but not least the solution.
02:15:57 [W1] I didn't forget. So let's go back to the laptop.
02:16:04 [W1] Alright, so here we go. Again. Remember my task was to find the pods on any nodes with the highest memory limit and write the name of the Pod to this file.
02:16:15 [W1] So I already know this is a three node cluster.
02:16:20 [W1] I'm going to do Cube CTL describe node, and look at what is running on each of these nodes.
02:16:29 [W1] Looks like the first one it's called DNS it CD in a bunch of cube Cube containers.
02:16:37 [W1] And the one with the highest memory limit is the core DNS pods with a hundred and seventy. I'm going to do the same again for the kubernative node 0
02:16:52 [W1] do I see anything with more than 170?
02:16:57 [W1] Nope?
02:16:58 [W1] Okay.
02:16:58 [W1] And same again.
02:16:59 [W1] I don't see anything higher than a hundred seventy.
02:17:01 [W1] So if I remember correctly, this is actually a tie there were two pods which both have a hundred and seventy as a memory limit of a hundred seventy.
02:17:10 [W1] Let me take these and I'm going to Echo these into the
02:17:20 [W1] the file that I was told to
02:17:24 [W1] so looks like I've got one and then the second one.
02:17:40 [W1] Okay, and just to confirm that I actually did do it.
02:17:45 [W1] Let me use cats to check this file.
02:17:50 [W1] And yeah all is good.
02:17:52 [W1] Did you get it right if you got it right then well done.
02:17:56 [W1] Happy certifying and have a fantastic people.
02:18:08 [W1] Thank you so much Cheryl next up. We have Alina / her check.
02:18:13 [W1] She is a software engineer at apple and a member of the cncf technical oversight committee.
02:18:20 [W1] And today she'll be sharing some some of apples Journey.
02:18:24 [W1] All is good.
02:18:12 [W1] Did you get it right if you got it right then well done.
02:18:16 [W1] Happy certifying and have a fantastic View.
02:18:28 [W1] Thank you so much Cheryl next up. We have Alina / her Chuck.
02:18:33 [W1] She is a software engineer at apple and a member of the cncf technical oversight committee. And today she'll be sharing some some of apples Journey.
02:18:44 [W1] It's a cloud native, which I'm super excited about, please welcome Elena.
02:19:04 [W1] Hello everyone.
02:19:05 [W1] My name is Alina and I work for Apple.
02:19:07 [W1] I joined the company as a software engineer about a year ago to work on kubernative and Cloud native projects since then so many people from the open source Community have asked me what attracted me the most to my new job and the answer is easy.
02:19:33 [W1] Hello everyone.
02:19:34 [W1] My name is Alina and I work for Apple.
02:19:37 [W1] I joined the company as a software engineer about a year ago to work on kubernative and Cloud native projects since then so many people from the open source Community have asked me what attracted me the most to my new job and the answer is easy.
02:19:56 [W1] The cloud infrastructure and the variety of applications running on it before I mainly focus on kubenetes clusters provisioning.
02:20:04 [W1] I thought that looking at things from the application and end user and got scale would help to complete the circle.
02:20:10 [W1] So here I am.
02:20:12 [W1] When you join a new team or company getting to know its history helps to understand current decisions and trade-offs measures has been used at Apple for over five years with an internally build container orchestrator called grpc.
02:20:25 [W1] It had a good reputation as a scheduling platform and it's killed well to support multiple Frameworks for running a variety of services like by stateful and stateless, but the container orchestrator soon became a bottleneck for
02:20:40 [W1] And so we started considering other choices.
02:20:43 [W1] In addition to masses Apple use some other solutions for compute management along with the transition. We wanted to consolidate them and provide the unified platform for better capacity utilization.
02:20:54 [W1] We found that kubernative was an obvious winner as an orchestrator.
02:21:01 [W1] With kubernative being more generic in pluggable.
02:21:04 [W1] it meant we could better divide work mountains the decisions on what provider to choose four core components like storage in time and network.
02:21:13 [W1] We're no longer life or death decisions.
02:21:15 [W1] We knew that it was just a plug-in choice and the choice could always be re-evaluated without refactoring the entire system.
02:21:22 [W1] Another big point of Attraction for developers was an ability to extend kubernative zp eyes and core functionality by leveraging cri-o.
02:21:31 [W1] And custom controllers the kubernative community was a huge asset to the platform its transparency and power was so obvious and provided a great level of comfort to developers.
02:21:44 [W1] The goal was to meet the demand of diverse user.
02:21:48 [W1] Please we had teams who were already successfully running kubernative clusters in their organization and we had people who had never worked with kubernetes before but trusted the technology and wanted to adopt it when the change of this magnitude
02:22:04 [W1] The communities Community was a huge asset to the platform its transparency and power was so obvious and provided a great level of comfort to Developers.
02:22:09 [W1] The goal was to meet the demand of diverse user.
02:22:14 [W1] Peace we had teams who were already successfully running kubernative clusters in their organization, and we had people who had never worked with kubernetes before but trusted the technology and wanted to adopted when the change of this magnitude
02:22:47 [W1] it is important to be honest about
02:23:07 [W1] the trade-offs that need to be made for successful migration.
02:23:12 [W1] It is a known fact that kubernative learning curve is steep. Not only for end users but for platform developers to
02:23:20 [W1] All the platform features that were built in the past had to be re-evaluated is the features current design aligned with the cloud native best practices.
02:23:29 [W1] is this feature even relevant to the new platform asking and answering these questions can be uncomfortable for people and software is built by people.
02:23:39 [W1] We had to accept the fact that there would be a need for a change to the current processes and people would have to adapt
02:23:47 [W1] we realized the impact of the decision. We were ready to invest in training resources and provide full support for developers anything to make that option successful at that point with the net is became our platform choice for compute management terrible.
02:24:03 [W1] Our Target goal is to make the majority of Apple workloads run on kubernative.
02:24:08 [W1] And software is built by people.
02:24:10 [W1] We had to accept the fact that there would be a need for a change to the current processes and people would have to adapt.
02:24:18 [W1] We realized the impact of the decision.
02:24:20 [W1] We were ready to invest in training resources and provide full support for developers anything to make that option successful at that point with the net is became our platform choice for compute management at Apple.
02:24:34 [W1] Our Target goal is to make the majority of Apple workloads run on kubernative.
02:24:39 [W1] We want to maintain end-user Focus while building the platform that required us to understand and categorize our platform users to establish common patterns for hardware and software infrastructure planning.
02:24:54 [W1] One category of users are Java python go developers who want to test and run their applications in the containers. Another category are applications s eries whose focus is on building Advanced deployment workflows for their teams.
02:25:24 [W1] for structure planning
02:25:26 [W1] one category of users are Java python go developers who want to test and run their applications in the containers?
02:25:33 [W1] Another category are applications s eries whose focus is on building Advanced deployment workflows for their teams.
02:25:41 [W1] Another example is hard work. We engineer's who are not afraid to try new things and explore Creative Solutions using Cloud native tools anything to make it easier for Hardware teams to validate devices.
02:25:55 [W1] their machine learning and watch workloads Engineers who utilize the plot from daily running thousands of but jobs that use both CPU and GPU use for training machine learning models Finance is also a platform user as they're a big part of placement decisions and
02:26:10 [W1] Neighing all of this users want to adopt Cloud native tools for better debugging logging monitoring and tracing for their apps.
02:26:18 [W1] Our responsibility as flowed from developers is to provide a scalable artist raishin layer.
02:26:24 [W1] secure resource isolation and reliable scheduling building high level abstractions and CLI tools is also necessary for the plot from success and adoption.
02:26:36 [W1] So we have this big infrastructure pool of compute and storage resources managed by Kudo. Nerys providing it to users can be done in two ways cluster has a service and namespace as a service.
02:26:50 [W1] namespace is a service is our primary model today as I re managers multi-tenant kubernative clusters and user appears in one or multiple namespaces.
02:27:01 [W1] This way users do not have an overhead of infrastructure management and configuration.
02:27:06 [W1] Focus on application deployment and development.
02:27:09 [W1] However, we realize that in the world workloads Structural Engineering has been commodified some teams may still want cluster as a service.
02:27:19 [W1] With a goal of centralized capacity control we had to obstruct Resource Management to its own system. We wanted to make it as G Eric as possible to streamline the solution for the hybrid cloud in the future.
02:27:31 [W1] That is provided to users can be done in two ways cluster as a service and namespace as a service namespaces a service is our primary model today as I re managers multi-tenant kubernative
02:29:55 [W1] Location resource isolation would be handled by assigning priority and quarter to each workloads.
02:30:15 [W1] Even with a namespace as a service constraints we wanted users to have a freedom to choose Cloud native tools to run in there namespaces. Some of these tools require crd is a cluster level resource.
02:30:27 [W1] We had to think of a proper ci/cd management flow to make the deployment possible.
02:30:33 [W1] Solving this technical challenges would not have been possible without the wide array of cloud native tools those we use on the platform level and those who recommend to application Developers.
02:30:44 [W1] This list is not complete.
02:32:13 [W1] And keeps on growing as we constantly evaluate new projects and find more areas for development and integration.
02:32:21 [W1] With all the careful planning only running things at scale could reveal certain issues.
02:32:26 [W1] We have chosen open source, kubernative probe test cluster Lauder to the challenge. Our cluster is developers can always write their own framework, but we found cluster elotl been quite profile. We wanted to engage more with the
02:32:41 [W1] As time and fixing and expanding the existing tool that could be used by others.
02:32:37 [W1] Another area of emitted Focus was scheduling we run mixed types of workloads and kubernative including Bosch workloads and want to maintain a reasonable resource utilization participating in six scheduling and contributing back is very important to
02:32:52 [W1] You want to stay as close to the Upstream as possible for some people in our team.
02:32:46 [W1] It was their very first experience contributing to Upstream kubernative going through the process of joining sick for discussions filing first, kubernative these issues and recognizing the various ways to help the community. It was all new and exciting.
02:33:00 [W1] I would like to share some of our current priorities.
02:33:04 [W1] In a multi-tenant environment many customers workloads around on the same machine to meet security requirements and provide isolation between mix level of trust a common pattern is to leverage defense in depth.
02:33:18 [W1] We are seeking to enable this level of isolation with micro VMS with that multiple untrusting tenants can run on the same notes and share the same control plane while continuing to provide two layers of isolation virtual machine and
02:33:33 [W1] Plus there is a certain is comes to the cost of increased Security Management resource utilization in efficiency and operational burden in the company's of Apple scale as a result.
02:33:44 [W1] We started exploring alternative models like virtual clusters with virtual cluster user self services virtualized kubernative control and data plane on top of shared kubernative infrastructure.
02:33:56 [W1] eliminates the majority of security and attritional concerns.
02:34:01 [W1] With the deployment footprint growth and distribution cross data centers comes the demand for multi cluster workloads management.
02:34:09 [W1] We are researching on API haproxy solution offer improved self healing utilization efficiency high level abstractions and developer workflow experiences for teams that manage workloads across multiple clusters.
02:34:21 [W1] We want to reduce the plot from complexity for developers and operators at the same time. We want to maintain high security standards and low resource utilization.
02:34:31 [W1] So we are investing in function as a service solution leveraging server site webassembly to solve this.
02:34:38 [W1] With a constant editions of the new features and user workloads observability becomes one of the top priorities. We want to keep the platform management saying as the platform growth
02:34:50 [W1] And user productivity and happiness is our end goal.
02:35:46 [W1] Adopting new technology on such a big scale often comes hand in hand with organizational changes.
02:35:52 [W1] You need to change everything and everyone from managers and finance to tag teams and yourself.
02:35:59 [W1] It is a long road with a lot of growing pains our security team grew and took on extra responsibilities.
02:36:07 [W1] Ensuring security and multi-tenant cluster is not a trivial task.
02:36:11 [W1] Adopting new technology on such a big scale often comes hand in hand with organizational changes.
02:36:15 [W1] You need to change everything and everyone from managers and finance to tag teams and yourself.
02:36:21 [W1] It is a long road with a load of growing pains our security team grew and took on extra responsibilities.
02:36:30 [W1] Insurance security and multi-tenant cluster is not a trivial task.
02:36:33 [W1] We had to have a clear separation of concern between application security and kubernative platform security to maintain a shared responsibility model.
02:36:43 [W1] One of our goals was to rethink about City Planning having a dedicated resource management team working close with the finance department was necessary. Some new teams were formed some grew in size and responsibilities and some
02:37:00 [W1] security to maintain a shared responsibility model
02:37:04 [W1] One of our goals was to rethink about City Planning having a dedicated resource management team working close with the finance department was necessary. Some new teams were formed some grew in size and responsibilities and some
02:37:20 [W1] S every team used to be more operational and systems focused now, it has an emphasis on engineering and a much stronger voice in the platform architectural design having a solid and stable platform made it possible to maintain focus on the
02:37:35 [W1] and innovate Foster
02:37:37 [W1] Innovation is impossible without collaboration Forum in a cross team technical review board for cloud native based projects was invaluable to us.
02:37:46 [W1] It is a safe place to get peer feedback from people having different backgrounds.
02:37:52 [W1] Some have more experience with developing features for kubernative and some have a deep expertise in a particular technical domain like security getting their combined input is extremely useful during the design stage.
02:38:05 [W1] With a shared platform shared information becomes a necessity.
02:38:08 [W1] We are likely to have a dedicated team managing inner source and open source initiatives here at Apple the team focuses on internal trainings on cloud native and Kudo knative advises people who want to start making their first open source contributions
02:38:23 [W1] I'm cheered information becomes a necessity.
02:38:24 [W1] We are likely to have a dedicated team managing inner source and open source initiatives here at Apple the team focuses on internal trainings on cloud native and kubernative advises people who want to start making their first open source contributions
02:38:49 [W1] For those who have been contributing for to open source for a while.
02:38:54 [W1] The team helps to connect people and grow both internal and external collaborations.
02:39:01 [W1] The ongoing transformation leaves a very little time for reflection, but the reflection is always necessary migration is not something everyone wants to do but those who invest in the modernizing their application and the platform benefit in the future by
02:39:16 [W1] Loud knative technologists on top of the foundation.
02:39:19 [W1] Migration at scale has taught us to embrace the community best practices and shared learnings.
02:39:25 [W1] We wanted to give back and have realized that engagement comes in many forms writing code serving on Toc board for cncf helping kubernative release team improving documentation file in issues and many more
02:39:40 [W1] Engagement comes in many forms writing code serving on Toc board for cncf helping kubernative release team improving documentation file in issues and many more Innovation is driven by sharing and collaboration.
02:40:06 [W1] And is driven by sharing and collaboration sharing with the broader community in the open source sharing with another team in your company through the inner Source helps to enable reuse of existing Solutions and minimize the redundancy even
02:40:21 [W1] Helps to enable reuse of existing Solutions and minimize the redundancy. Even Small Change can begin to make larger cultural change a reality.
02:40:30 [W1] We have realized that in the end the migration changes not just a technical stackrox, but the people involved in it.
02:40:37 [W1] Please reach out to us if you have any questions, thank you.
02:40:47 [W1] Thank you Elena.
02:40:48 [W1] Just also for anyone who is new to this to Kook on especially since we can't do round of applause. Don't forget to do the virtual clapping within the slack Channel.
02:40:59 [W1] All right, so use those waves also Priyanka and Cheryl should definitely get a college as well since we haven't had a chance to give them a round of applause.
02:41:07 [W1] I also want to give all of you a round of applause for turning this into a low test.
02:41:13 [W1] all working on addressing.
02:41:17 [W1] Without pausing issues. So just let you know that we were seeing it and we are addressing it and we are working to get this back as soon as possible. And now for our next presenter, our next presenter is Diane Mueller.
02:41:30 [W1] She is the director of Community Development at red hat and today Diane will discuss the impact end users are making on open source and have a canoe sure that success please welcome Diane Mueller and give her a round of applause.
02:41:43 [W1] Red hat, and I'm really excited to be here today to talk with you about.
02:42:27 [W1] Hey everybody.
02:42:28 [W1] I'm Diane dealer and I'm the director of Community Development at red hat and I'm really excited to be here today to talk with you about end users and more specifically about the phenomenal rise in participation of end users in open source communities across the cloud native ecosystem in many ways. This is
02:42:43 [W1] her to end users in my way of expressing my virtual gratitude for all the many contributions that end users have made that have helped Drive Innovation into the projects and products and services that I and the rest of red hat have had the privilege to work on in collaboration
02:42:50 [W1] / in the audience today over the past years like many of you open source fuels my work. It gives me a mission allows me to contribute to make
02:42:59 [W1] the world a better place and hopefully to be a catalyst for others to participate and contribute to building a better world for all of us. We have barely scratched the surface of the eye.
02:45:00 [W1] opportunity that is ahead of us as we all know open source has a future and the rise in end user participation has enabled us to dramatically scale and accelerate what we're doing today to continue to do so, we need to evolve and nurture that
02:45:23 [W1] Virtuous end user cycle that Priyanka Sharma so eloquently pointed out at the last can comb and this will ensure all of our successes and help all of us grow. Our communities today end users are not just giving feedback.
02:45:36 [W1] They're building side by side with us. We have projects like metal cube that while it may have sprung from Red Hat now is key maintainers and dedicated engineering resources from Erickson working full-time to
02:45:57 [W1] Drive this project for we've seen major donations of fully formed projects and code bases such as Jaeger and Uber and Envoy from lift and backstage from Spotify and many more that are evidenced in the cncf landscape.
02:46:12 [W1] Red Hat now is key maintainers and dedicated engineering resources from Erickson working full-time to
02:46:26 [W1] Drive this project forward we've seen major donations of fully formed projects and code bases such as Jaeger and Uber and Envoy from lift and backstage from Spotify and many more that are evidenced in the cncf landscape.
02:46:40 [W1] that is literally bursting at the seams with projects filling the sandboxes and launching themselves and GitHub repos, and we're now seeing a new emerging trend of end users sharing up the stack and openly discussing their workloads and how they've implemented.
02:46:54 [W1] Such as with Telco is like America movil and their Enterprise neurosystem initiative in which they're sharing their AI Ops expertise and implementation to bring more efficiency to all of their Enterprises using the open source way.
02:47:08 [W1] They're taking Enterprise and Industry specific user groups to an entirely new level.
02:47:16 [W1] And while vendors continue including Red Hat divided to be seen as the top contributors and engineering resources dedicated to a cncf projects and believe me. We are all grateful for those continued contributions.
02:47:29 [W1] So please do all keep bracing for that Top Notch the real Trend that we should be proud of and to continue to nurture can be seen further down in the dev stats and the stack analytics and other dashboards is in the huge rise of
02:47:44 [W1] Actively participating in our working groups at all level I'd be hugely remiss if I didn't give a shout out and thank you to all the end-user participants in the openshift communities and especially those in the okd working group that are helping Drive the collaboration across
02:47:59 [W1] If I didn't give a shout out and thank you to the all the end-user participants in the openshift communities and especially those in the okd working group that are helping Drive the collaboration across openshift okd Fedora core OS and operators and lots of others.
02:48:14 [W1] Fedora core OS and operators and lots of others, you know, that's I'm hugely grateful for that and it wouldn't be possible without the end user participation and contributions.
02:48:27 [W1] There are now end users on the cncf TOC and on the board and in this and you can see them in the cncf end user Community initiatives and creating these spaces isn't hugely important to give them voice, but there's
02:48:42 [W1] It's more work to be done as not all end users and corporations are able to participate yet.
02:48:48 [W1] We've seen peer to peer coaching from those that are participating.
02:48:53 [W1] we've seen the rise of Enterprises launching their own open source program offices like at Salesforce and in at Apple and the creation of rules, like open source officers at Bosch
02:49:09 [W1] The more we can do to help or their organizations and their management teams understand the value of open information and Innovation the more resources they can bring to the party.
02:49:21 [W1] Projects like that of the cncf contributor to contributor Sig that's doing great work on creating clear pass from boarding participants into our communities need to be raised up and made more visible their work around embedding and creating clear
02:49:36 [W1] Unity's need to be raised up and made more visible their work around embedding and creating clear contribution letters ladders so that the path from newbie to maintain Andrews clear and open and inclusive
02:49:49 [W1] Many projects already have well-trodden well-documented pass like Helm and Envoy and now Porter's got a great one I call on all of the project leads out of our communities and others to revisit and talk to the end
02:50:04 [W1] Coming year to ensure their projects have well-documented paths or onboarding and growing their maintainers.
02:50:11 [W1] This will ensure the sustainability and health of all their efforts and all of our efforts open source open formats. Open Standards have not only changed technology.
02:50:20 [W1] They've also changed our society for good the role of end users in this cannot be understated by nurturing and making spaces for end users. We have the opportunity to accelerate this work at a greater scale and show
02:50:34 [W1] everyone that open really does unlock the world's potential.
02:50:40 [W1] So thank you.
02:50:41 [W1] We look forward to continuing to collaborate with all of you across the ecosystem.
02:50:45 [W1] Have a great coupon stay open. They safe be well.
02:50:55 [W1] Thank you so much Diane.
02:50:57 [W1] I love the message about the end user community and I hope to see more of you in and around Cloud native projects.
02:51:04 [W1] So next up we have constants.
02:51:07 [W1] my silly co-chair partner in crime for for promos and other things Constance is a principle software engineer at Splunk and she will be talking about cncf project updates today.
02:51:21 [W1] Take it away.
02:51:30 [W1] I'm Constance caramel has and I'll be doing your cncf project updates today.
02:51:36 [W1] Before we get started.
02:51:37 [W1] I want to talk a little bit about something. We're changing this time try and see how it goes as you'll notice during this Kook on cloud native con. There's an increased focus on telling end user stories and we're going to continue that theme here today during project updates.
02:51:50 [W1] Let's get started.
02:51:54 [W1] Our first project and talk about is Falco Falco is a runtime security project and it consumed signals from the Linux kernel and container management tools such as Doctrine kubernative Falco Parsons these signals and assert some again security rules.
02:52:09 [W1] Was violated our Learners triggered?
02:51:51 [W1] Now, let's look at some of the cool statistics that have happened in the past year.
02:51:56 [W1] One there have been over seven hundred thousand downloads of the kernel module in 10 days.
02:52:03 [W1] That's an amazing number 60 new contributors this year and these contributors come from companies like IBM covr Shopify AWS appdynamics in a team really wide variety of contributors. That's amazing.
02:52:20 [W1] There are 12 adopters and many independent users. Now what have been some updates to the project.
02:52:27 [W1] One is a user space driver additions such as support for fargate workloads using p dig support for armed 64 arm7.
02:52:36 [W1] Yes, that means lower energy processing.
02:52:41 [W1] Stability / improvements to the Falco engine for better performance additional Community Integrations such as Falco sidekick and a growing number of additional Community creations.
02:52:54 [W1] And there's been some user adoption improvements such as improved Helm charts Falco CTL vocal cuddle.
02:53:02 [W1] I'm going to need someone to correct that for me afterwards Falco exporter for Prometheus and Improvement generators event generators.
02:53:09 [W1] Gordon this is really wonderful to see in terms of end user.
02:53:08 [W1] I will not be able to do justice to shame Lawrence and Chris nóva if you didn't have a chance, I highly suggest for you to look to watch their keynote from EU Shane Lawrence comes from Shopify and he describes
02:53:24 [W1] What how Shopify uses Falco to give you the TLD W the too long didn't watch Shopify uses Falco and it's rule sets in production for detection and prevention.
02:53:20 [W1] It does things such as detecting data egress example coredns mining metadata server abuse and a remote code execution output.
02:53:29 [W1] Please check out their keynote. They will do much better description of how things are done. Thank you.
02:53:38 [W1] Shopify Shane Lawrence and Chris Nobles overdoing Kuma you and thank you Falco.
02:53:46 [W1] On to our next project Thanos Thanos is a Prometheus base scalable time series data base that provides a global query View High availability and data backup with historical cheap access as its core features all
02:54:01 [W1] single binary
02:54:04 [W1] they say it is three years old.
02:54:07 [W1] They have 281 contributors and direct quote from the maintainers.
02:54:11 [W1] They are very grateful for that.
02:54:12 [W1] Thank you contributors.
02:54:13 [W1] There are sixty five hundred stargazers and in 2020, they focus on mentoring.
02:54:21 [W1] They had nine students.
02:54:23 [W1] came from programs like cncf Community bridge and Google summer of code, and they had a really positive impact on the project. I'll mention one of their additions in a minute.
02:54:34 [W1] And they have high commit velocity over the past year.
02:54:37 [W1] They've been averaging six commits per day.
02:54:39 [W1] This is amazing.
02:54:40 [W1] This is a chart here on the right that I want to see for everyone.
02:54:44 [W1] This is just great work everyone.
02:54:47 [W1] What about some updates?
02:54:50 [W1] So we need to give us a nose around of Applause that virtual Round of Applause and sock everyone.
02:54:56 [W1] It has reached incubation status and April 20 20.
02:55:00 [W1] Congratulations Thanos community.
02:55:01 [W1] That is great work.
02:55:04 [W1] They've added support for knative response cache and collaboration with cortex project.
02:55:08 [W1] Another thing.
02:55:09 [W1] I want to highlight collaboration with other projects.
02:55:12 [W1] This makes me really happy to see it is, you know, we are all providing solutions for the cognitive world and seeing this collaboration just makes me really happy.
02:55:23 [W1] They've added new react you eyes to all components.
02:55:26 [W1] This is also a really big thank you to the community and to the mentees.
02:55:32 [W1] There is a heavy focus on analytics olap Integrations through absolute. Exclaim Unity sub-project.
02:55:39 [W1] There's offer full multi-tenancy. This allows for flexible deployment of various read storage and right tendency.
02:55:48 [W1] And the root of the limitation of from career prom cool single CPU concurrency and Prometheus.
02:55:53 [W1] That means it's multi-core.
02:55:56 [W1] It has sped up querying.
02:55:57 [W1] thank you Thanos. Let's talk about Rook.
02:56:04 [W1] Now we have to give Rook around of Applause. They graduated earlier this year.
02:56:12 [W1] Rook provides an open source storage solution for kubernative use through operators in C RDS. It automates management of storage providers including ceph NFS Cassandra cockroach DB and yugabyte DB.
02:56:27 [W1] There are over 7800 stargazers.
02:56:32 [W1] 295 contributors the ones you want me to say again.
02:56:36 [W1] Thank you to The Rook community maintainers.
02:56:41 [W1] Over a hundred eighty million downloads amazing.
02:56:45 [W1] And most recently there's really Savvy 1.5 and it contains improvements such as support for Stuff stretch clusters encryption with KMS and mirroring block data across clusters.
02:57:00 [W1] Now the next end-user I'm really excited about well, so because it's not, you know, we don't really hear so much about research and education use cases.
02:57:08 [W1] So the Pacific research platform project is a partnership across many many institutions both at the governmental level National Science Foundation Department of energy and also multiple research universities
02:57:23 [W1] In the United States and around the world.
02:57:25 [W1] So PRP aims to create a seamless research platform that encourages collaboration on a broad range of data intensive fields and projects now naturally using karate has was a good idea for that.
02:57:40 [W1] So they run a kubernative cluster.
02:57:42 [W1] It's mostly located in California, but also other parts of the country and they have some nodes and Pacific Asian region in Europe.
02:57:48 [W1] All of this is connected through a with a fast ten hundred Deer research Network.
02:57:56 [W1] Now this cluster incorporates Force F clusters managed by Rook to petabyte-scale in the u.s.
02:58:02 [W1] Western region five hundred terabytes in u.s.
02:58:05 [W1] Eastern Region 8 terabytes video wall SSD only local a hundred 30 terabytes nvme only local and soon to be added in asia-pacific fool.
02:58:18 [W1] now the following is a direct quote from PRP about how Rook has enabled them to be successful Rook is tremendously helping us to deploy a reliably a reliable fast or too scientific users Rook makes administration of a large
02:58:46 [W1] Relations easier and remove multi multiple tasks of nodes management from personnel which helps reduce costs and increase efficiency data storage is a key component of scientific Computing computations and Rook does a perfectly for us. Thank you.
02:59:01 [W1] P and thank you Rick for sharing.
02:59:05 [W1] I'm to the last project we're going to talk about today is the test.
02:59:09 [W1] The test is a database solution for deploying scaling and managing large clusters of Open Source database instances It Sports MySQL and mariadb it is architected to run as effectively on public or private Cloud architecture as it
02:59:24 [W1] Dedicated hardware and it combines and extends many important SQL features of the scalability of nosql database.
02:59:31 [W1] And so some of the things problems, you know that I tries to solve our scaling SQL database by sharding it migrating from bare metal to private private or public Cloud not reliably as one word was trying to say and
02:59:47 [W1] pulling in managing a large number of scale SQL database instances
02:59:53 [W1] One fun fact that I know about before is of a Tesla was actually running on kubernative.
02:59:59 [W1] Zat YouTube before kubernative 1.0 around for a while. That's awesome.
03:00:05 [W1] In terms of some updates there been four major releases this year and the latest release 8.0 is compatible with over 10 modern SQL Frameworks, including WordPress and Ruby on Rails active record.
03:00:19 [W1] And for last 10 years our story slack, so the beginning of 2017 slack began adoption of a test.
03:00:29 [W1] by in August of 2017.
03:00:33 [W1] It started serving production traffic.
03:00:37 [W1] After completing a re-architecture and migration of slacks core product features by early 2020 roughly Center Center traffic was passing through the tests, and they had designed a framework to migrate one table at a time. Now, you're probably wondering what about
03:00:52 [W1] Reading 30% and that is the Crux of the problem.
03:00:56 [W1] They had done a calculation that it would take three to five years at least for engineers to migrate the remaining 30% of the Legacy system.
03:01:05 [W1] And that's a really long time. Now, they knew it was going to take a while and so in 2019, they spend effort investigating alternative strategy or alternative strategies to do the migration and what they found was if
03:01:20 [W1] Leveraging of your application functionality that they can migrate entire clusters to the test.
03:01:26 [W1] Now this resulted in as of now the 99% of traffic at slac uses the test and that the migration will be complete by end of year.
03:01:39 [W1] And just to share direct quote we moved hundreds of terabytes of data over a thousand MySQL shards zero downtime not a single outage equally important.
03:01:50 [W1] It was transparent her applications. Thank you so much for sharing and thank you for tests.
03:01:56 [W1] Now before we cut off for a moment, I want to call us another graduations take Abby.
03:02:05 [W1] TUF the update framework
03:02:09 [W1] Harbor
03:02:11 [W1] And Helm, these are other projects that have graduated since we all met together in San Diego last year.
03:02:17 [W1] Please give them a virtual Round of Applause.
03:02:18 [W1] Use those slack emojis, please congratulations to the community contributors maintainers a lot of hard work and it's well earned.
03:02:29 [W1] At our last Mets last message of the day.
03:02:31 [W1] Please go to cncf dot IO / projects to get a full list of all the different projects that are supported and also use leverage maintainer track session the meet the maintainers.
03:02:42 [W1] Sure, you probably have a lot of questions.
03:02:44 [W1] And so please use this time to reach out to find out what's going on with the project and asked, you know get answers to your questions.
03:02:51 [W1] Thank you very much everyone and have good coupon by.
03:03:01 [W1] Thank you so much constants for those project updates.
03:03:04 [W1] So exciting to see all the activity happening across the landscape next up. We have dr.
03:03:11 [W1] Shin Jang. He is a VP of volcano engine at bite dance and we'll be talking about volcano engines Cloud native Journey, please welcome. Dr. Zhang.
03:03:40 [W1] I'm a VP of volcano engine are by dance.
03:03:44 [W1] I feel very honored to be here to present to you about what we do why and how we approach it?
03:03:51 [W1] by August 20 2013 the most popular short video content platform in China has reached 600 million da you or daily active user and the Mau or monthly active user of all Biden's apps
03:04:07 [W1] Has reached 1.5 billion globally we're talking about the Rockies big growth here.
03:04:13 [W1] Given the huge amount of Diversified content and information are platforms carry and for though in this video content aggregation editing analysis and a recommendation.
03:04:24 [W1] are highly relevant with real-time distributed storage Computing capacity and orchestration.
03:04:33 [W1] It has never been an easy task to manage them all at a such scalability.
03:04:40 [W1] Over time we have generated a coherent framework that works from the infrastructure operating system level to meet platform then end-to-end sweets for growth that can also be paired with various industrialized
03:04:55 [W1] Illusions such capabilities and the methodology have been quickly serving the needs of various business lines or units in by dance over the past eight years, as you know Hotel doughy were the early ones and
03:05:10 [W1] And data mobile Etc.
03:05:12 [W1] Now all these come in combo in volcano engine.
03:05:17 [W1] We call this coherent framework one set and with these sweets and capabilities.
03:05:23 [W1] Volcano engine has boosted by dense growth in the past in the similar manner were thinking we can help other companies or Enterprises to grow by using the same set of core Technologies and the best practices.
03:05:38 [W1] That's the essence and the mission of volcano engine as mentioned during the years.
03:05:44 [W1] We have built all these phenomenal apps like though in we have been faced with the growth of millions of users and content.
03:05:52 [W1] need cloudevents.
03:06:07 [W1] And on lots of times we need to go against the traditional go to habits of building apps from static and monolithic to achieve scalability in a cloud knative way from our experience
03:06:22 [W1] Clown native in production.
03:06:24 [W1] It's not only about shifting a single app or as data set up to the cloud or automating certain tasks or integration.
03:06:31 [W1] It's about seriously having the whole business to the cloud native level a complete transformation that involves technical procedural and sometimes even organizational challenges.
03:06:44 [W1] While Ken anjan has been going the clown 84 way since very early on build on the half million notes scale.
03:06:51 [W1] We're dealing with we gain experience and had valuable and vital lessons, which could be also useful to companies and developers in the community who are going through the same Cloud native transformation and confusion
03:07:06 [W1] We're interested to share and exchange this information and insight with the community friends. And at the same time, we'd love to continue to contribute to the open source projects including kubernative kubeflow.
03:07:19 [W1] Not only the cloud native oxygen projects, but also those relevant with data-driven goals
03:07:28 [W1] and the debut on the cube can't stake today is a very important milestone for volcano engine to present its cloudevents Tory. We hope to connect with every one of you in the community to inspire creativity and in reach our
03:07:43 [W1] knative life
03:07:49 [W1] Thank you.
03:07:49 [W1] Thank you.
03:07:49 [W1] Thank you.
03:07:49 [W1] Thank you.
03:07:50 [W1] Thank you. Dr. Shin Jang.
03:07:51 [W1] Don't forget do round of applauses in the Keynotes Channel or the hallway.
03:07:55 [W1] Just leave the event help desk for any questions.
03:07:58 [W1] But thank you. Once again, dr.
03:08:00 [W1] Shin Jang.
03:08:00 [W1] Our next presenter is Brianna Frank.
03:08:03 [W1] Brianna is the director of product at IBM cloud and today she'll discuss how communities everywhere can ultimately power 5 G tellers blanking and distribute analytics, please welcome, Brianna Frank.
03:08:40 [W1] Hi, I'm Brianna Frank.
03:08:41 [W1] I am the director of product at IBM cloud and I'm so excited to be here at coupon 2020.
03:08:48 [W1] So today I'm going to talk about this concept of kubernative.
03:08:51 [W1] He's but needed everywhere and I'm going to walk you through a few real world examples that I'm seeing across a couple different Industries where kubernative he's is needed, but it's needed in lots of different locations.
03:09:04 [W1] So the first example is in the financial industry and on the surface the financial industry might seem like it's all about money, but it's really all about technology in order to compete financial institutions need to create exceptional user experiences.
03:09:20 [W1] And they leverage Ai and trading algorithms to help stay ahead of the market, but it is also a very heavily regulated industry and so Financial Services clients need to iterate quickly leveraging Cloud native tools and best practices.
03:09:35 [W1] Is but they need to be able to keep that data secure and compliant in sometimes that means they might have there might be some restrictions on where that data can live.
03:09:48 [W1] So here's a scenario that's emerging to solve that problem distributed cloud or kubernative as a service anywhere and you know Gartner refers to it as distributed Cloud IDC calls it local Cloud as a service, but this is a
03:10:03 [W1] And to have where the public cloud is now extended to lots of different locations different public Cloud examples on-prem examples or even at the edge and so the key Point here is that distributed Cloud enables you to take advantage
03:10:18 [W1] Of a public Cloud consumption model but in many different locations and you don't have to be an expert in running these software Stacks to run them outside of the public cloud.
03:10:29 [W1] So let's take a look at an example of this concept of kubernative everywhere in action.
03:10:36 [W1] And so, you know in this example, one of our clients is really focused on worker safety.
03:10:42 [W1] And so they're leveraging distributed analytics to keep workers safe.
03:10:47 [W1] So in this scenario, you know, you might have a business or an office building that is actually under construction and you need to be able to leverage video analytics to tell if someone is wearing a hard hat or not and workloads.
03:10:59 [W1] In them before they move into a potentially dangerous area that building. So in this scenario you want to use video analytics, but you really can't have any latency because if you warn someone too late, they could possibly be injured or hurt.
03:11:15 [W1] So let's take a look at how this scenario might works.
03:11:20 [W1] So if you think about solving a safety problem, you need to be able to analyze video data from many cameras all over the office building and it's impractical to send all of that data back to the cloud to be processed remotely.
03:11:32 [W1] So for this scenario to work, well it would be better the video processing were to happen closer to the device.
03:11:39 [W1] So traditionally to do that. It would require you to install servers and software and manage them on.
03:11:45 [W1] Prem with kubernetes and distributed Cloud we can extend the public Cloud into the office so we can leverage cloud services to run this application close to the the device and that's critical so we can reduce latency and we can effectively warn someone.
03:12:00 [W1] Fine if they enter a dangerous area, so now what's interesting is that same workers scenario and client is having to evolve and you know because of covid there are new demands and new challenges that we have to adapt to
03:12:15 [W1] And so now that same client instead of having to warn someone about a hard hat.
03:12:21 [W1] We're really worried about making sure folks are wearing masks and making sure folks are wearing masks correctly and that the mask hasn't slipped Down Under the nose.
03:12:28 [W1] We're also leveraging thermal devices to take someone's temperature before they enter a congested area and we're also using video analytics to see how much usage is happening in a specific room and an office building
03:12:43 [W1] Or even a hospital so we can determine if that room needs to be sanitized.
03:12:48 [W1] So this is an example where you know, we had a really interesting, you know worker safety use case, but we're having to iterate quickly due to real world demands and some of these demands were hard to predict and so we have to be able to react quickly
03:13:03 [W1] And using this Cloud native best practices, but applying them to the edge.
03:13:08 [W1] Thank you so much for listening. If you'd like to learn more about kubernative everywhere go to IBM dot Biz flash coupon 2020.
03:13:17 [W1] Thank you so much and enjoy the rest of coupon.
03:13:31 [W1] Thank you, Brianna.
03:13:32 [W1] Keep the round of applause coming in the keynote annulled and next speaker.
03:13:37 [W1] He will definitely not be mr.
03:13:39 [W1] To our next presenter is Steven Augustus.
03:13:43 [W1] He is a senior open source engine RPM where he is also my co-chair and today he'll be giving some updates on kubernative, please welcome Steven Augustus.
03:14:02 [W1] Hello.
03:14:02 [W1] Hello everyone.
03:14:03 [W1] My name is Steven Augustus. And I am one of your co-chairs for Kube con Cloud knative Khan and a virtual.
03:14:09 [W1] I'm here to talk to you about the kubernative project and we're going to do some project updates. So let's jump into it.
03:14:19 [W1] Now the kubernative project is comprised of people and we believe in and we care deeply for the people that work on this project day to day.
03:14:29 [W1] It would be impossible to talk about what we did for the year without talking about the 2020 of it all now our response initially to to covid to dealing with
03:14:45 [W1] Kind of Shifting for a lot of people Shifting the way they worked Shifting the way they interacted with people and moving towards more virtual content moving towards
03:15:00 [W1] Less meetings when possible being more accommodating about time zones about families. So hat tip to everyone in the project that that really is involved. Sub-project owners Sig chairs and Technical leads committee members, who
03:15:16 [W1] we're incredibly present in conscious about how people are kind of coping with everything that's going on in the world and to that you may be familiar with the kubernative A's
03:15:31 [W1] IO website and we put up a we put up a banner on the website too clearly disclaim that racism is unacceptable race, and it's not something that we
03:15:46 [W1] Tolerate in the project We Believe deeply in our code of conduct and enforcing it to protect the members of of this project.
03:15:55 [W1] So again, hat tip to all of the folks that actually worked on applying the ability to give our website banners steering committee for working with me on the messaging and and
03:16:10 [W1] Delivering that and and holding holding the line.
03:16:13 [W1] I think that you know, it's very it's very easy for statements that can be deemed to be political to attract trolls and we had our fair share of that.
03:16:26 [W1] again hat tip to to everyone involved code of conduct committee steering committee contributor experience for taking on that burden for for feeling.
03:16:39 [W1] Feeling it necessary and important to speak about something.
03:16:44 [W1] that's not a political issue something that is human issue.
03:16:46 [W1] So the chairs and Technical leads we recently spun up.
03:16:53 [W1] It's not recently anymore.
03:16:55 [W1] It's been it's been quite some time now spun up a chair and Technical lead meetings. So giving an opportunity for all of our leadership across the project to sit down chat in in a
03:17:09 [W1] A safe space to exchange ideas without any, you know kind of the the the blameless retrospectives and the and you know having having that safe space to to
03:17:25 [W1] Create ideas that you may not feel comfortable sharing publicly.
03:17:30 [W1] Now. We also started the annual report process.
03:17:34 [W1] So the steering committee kick that off the annual reports essentially starting with the working groups having annual check ins for each of these governance groups giving us an opportunity to get a better feedback loop.
03:17:49 [W1] Between the the the groups that exist in our community and The Wider Community.
03:17:55 [W1] It's very easy to kind of operate in a vacuum. If you are if you don't have you know the chance to to speak about all the accomplishments that you've been doing and also and spread that out
03:18:10 [W1] To the community. So so great great work. They're all of the all the moderators again going back into just handling.
03:18:23 [W1] Handling all of the various of the various properties that we own across Twitter across the the website across discuss.
03:18:32 [W1] hat tip to everyone YouTube Zoom for making everything that we do safe to do and and welcoming.
03:18:45 [W1] Now speaking of Twitter that at the Kate's contributors Twitter handle, which is handled by by contributor experience and the the marketing sub-project of contribute experience.
03:18:59 [W1] So very awesome to see us being able to publish updates about the community more frequently to wider The Wider internet now the the triage kept which poddisruptionbudgets
03:19:14 [W1] Top now we have, you know made a lot of improvements in how we kind of decrease the burden for you to maintain your areas. Right? And I think
03:19:30 [W1] Part of it is was introducing this triage kept something that we discussed for quite some time to get some of the finer details worked out and apply the automation to to the process.
03:19:41 [W1] So hat tip to everyone that was involved there across contributor experience as well as as well as the the enhancements sub-teams and sub-project of sagarika texture.
03:19:56 [W1] The Ingress the Ingress enhancement went g a super exciting long-standing enhancement that has been has been in beta and and it is one of
03:20:11 [W1] Earlier enhancements so great to see the work around delivering that to General availability from the GitHub management side the GitHub Administration Management
03:20:26 [W1] Team has been hard at work deprecating the the kubernetes incubator org, all of the projects that are involved in that org. Some of them that may have been made no longer be maintained
03:20:41 [W1] We built something bigger and better and it lives somewhere else now, so kind of wrangling all of that information and kind of bringing us to the the sunset of the the incubator org.
03:20:55 [W1] now
03:20:57 [W1] first some Sig specific updates we have Sig usability.
03:21:02 [W1] So usability has been driving a user research study that has been that has gotten some really great data to Crunch on and that will be part of their Sig updates during the conference.
03:21:17 [W1] So hat tip to them for one forming over the last year as well as all of the work that they've done to better understand the people who consume kubernative.
03:21:27 [W1] He stated a from Sig multi cluster. The multi cluster service apis are in progress.
03:21:36 [W1] They're currently Alpha. They represent Some solid progress towards normalizing multi cluster deployments and making the next level of kubernative operations more manageable.
03:21:46 [W1] And that's definitely you know, that's definitely something that we consider with, you know, having all of these disparity environments. So how to say
03:21:57 [W1] Multi cluster from the storage side. The container object storage interface was released for both block and file Kate storage being able to build a similar interface for
03:22:12 [W1] for object storage is also coming PSC is
03:23:19 [W1] In down for that so we should see that soon generic ephemeral volumes. We're progressed across the last few Cycles CSI support for Windows, which is huge huge step forward for
03:23:34 [W1] Windows support on kubernative overall the volume snapshot feature is also progressed.
03:23:41 [W1] And yeah, so, you know moving into moving into Sig docks Sig Doc's did an awesome job on the website migration more modern theme easier to
03:23:56 [W1] 18 for their contributors and on the architecture side the production Readiness sub-project as well as the pr R reviews as part of kept our now making their way into the release cycle from the Sig
03:24:11 [W1] Side we've been working on tooling to make our lives easier to make your lives easier to make it easier to release kubernative overall to make it safer.
03:24:21 [W1] It's released kubernative.
03:24:22 [W1] So well as the working group Kate's infra who's been hard at work one.
03:24:27 [W1] You'll hear more about the G the Kate stop cri-o cut over from Google infrastructure to community infrastructure during the conference.
03:24:35 [W1] You'll hear more about the image promotion process how we're handling artifacts moving forward as we now
03:24:41 [W1] now own those artifacts and Community infrastructure.
03:24:45 [W1] And then finally the working group naming was formed right this this kind of ties back into the thought of making sure that this project is is inclusive and being being
03:25:00 [W1] Awful about the language that we use across both our code bases and our an R & R content overall.
03:25:09 [W1] So stay tuned for more details on that later in the conference and a as well as a community meeting from a new initiative that's happening on kind of The Wider Community across LF cncf
03:25:24 [W1] I have standards bodies different companies. So stay tuned for that. Thanks everyone later.
03:25:42 [W1] Thank you Stephen for sharing.
03:25:43 [W1] It is only part of it.
03:25:48 [W1] So thank you to all of our keynote speakers for kicking off the first set of key notes.
03:25:55 [W1] We have a few house each house house eating housekeeping items before we break first and foremost.
03:26:04 [W1] Don't forget to take care of yourself. We understand that the event can be overwhelming and have
03:26:09 [W1] They keep Cloud native. Well initiative virtually this includes chair stretching chair yoga meditation and even puppy and kitten cams. So get out your get out your little family.
03:26:23 [W1] Yes information for all of this can be found in the platform within the experiences suction and Constance. You want to talk more about experiences.
03:26:34 [W1] Yeah. So some of the experiences you can find information about virtual trivia and Escape rooms.
03:26:39 [W1] Virtual escape room sounds like a lot of fun. So you do need to sign up for these so definitely go to that part.
03:26:47 [W1] so next to the experience is tab, you'll see game on which is which it has all the information you need to participate in the virtual games to earn Badges and various prizes also and so after each session attend
03:27:02 [W1] I won't read it ha.
03:27:04 [W1] Oh, sorry.
03:27:05 [W1] Let me start that over again after each session you attend today.
03:27:09 [W1] We would appreciate you leaving any feedback on sketch.com which can be found on the session schedule page and lastly.
03:27:18 [W1] There are few folks that we need to thank because without them none of this would be possible.
03:27:24 [W1] So our Diamond sponsors are Platinum sponsors and gold sponsors as well as the Diversity Scholarship sponsors, please
03:27:32 [W1] Take the time to visit the sponsors in their virtual booths throughout the event and last but not least.
03:27:39 [W1] Thank you to our incredible incredible program committee and the track chairs that work tirelessly on helping us select the sessions for this event.
03:27:49 [W1] Yes.
03:27:50 [W1] Thank you so much that definitely made our process so much easier, and thank you everyone for joining us today.
03:27:57 [W1] Thank you also for your patience, please now join the keynote speakers within the keynote slack Channel.
03:28:02 [W1] On the cloudevents lack workspace for next 50 minutes ask any questions. You may have and breakout sessions begin again today at 3 p.m. Eastern. Thank you everyone and see you tomorrow.
03:28:14 [W1] Have fun.
03:28:22 [W1] Our job is to make kubernative easier and easier and easier to use either from an Ops point of view or developer point of view while acknowledging it is complex because we're solving a complex problem.
03:29:32 [W1] Kubernative will be boring as soon as we can make it boring.
03:29:35 [W1] Maybe after I retire it's already boring.
03:29:39 [W1] So I think we're well on our journey towards kubernative being boring.
03:29:43 [W1] It'll only be boring when it's done.
03:29:45 [W1] It'll only be done when it's no longer relevant.
03:33:24 [W1] our job is to make kubernative easier and easier and easier to use either from an Ops point of view or developer point of view while acknowledging it is complex because

01:31:26 [W1] Before we start our programming today.
01:31:29 [W1] I would like to play this message from Jim's emlyn the executive director of the Linux Foundation about cncf longtime leader Dan Khan who recently passed away due to complications from colon cancer.
01:31:49 [W1] You know 2020 has been a very tough year and you know Dan was as all of you know from this community Forever The Optimist and Problem Solver when he was diagnosed.
01:32:03 [W1] He sought to defy the odds and fight this disease as long as he could sadly and very suddenly things took a turn for the worse and Dan did succumb to his illness in a short time.
01:32:16 [W1] You know Dan played a special role at the foundation his impact far exceeded his time with us.
01:32:23 [W1] He helped establish the organization we are today and he oversaw the fastest-growing open source community in history your community the cloud native Computing Foundation.
01:32:37 [W1] Dan was also a Pioneer in 1994.
01:32:41 [W1] Something all of us use almost every day.
01:32:45 [W1] Dan was opinionated.
01:32:46 [W1] He never strayed from a debate via email or in person, you know, I love to go to dinners with Dan because I knew the conversation would always be interesting and I wouldn't have to say a word.
01:33:01 [W1] Does that sound familiar to anybody you know in the open source community?
01:33:06 [W1] Indeed it does because Dan was one of you and we're lucky to spend time with him.
01:33:15 [W1] What you may not know about Dan was his lifelong desire to help others.
01:33:21 [W1] From serving as a volunteer firefighter in college to his constant advocacy to encourage diversity in the cncf community and an open source in general to stepping aside from his role in
01:33:36 [W1] Foundation to incubate and found the Linux Foundation Public Health Initiative, which is helping Public Health authorities around the world combat covid-19.
01:33:34 [W1] Dan could always be counted on to help in a crisis.
01:33:39 [W1] Initial reactions to his death from members of our community and many of you are full of statements Dan help me paired with a life or career changing impact many of us
01:33:55 [W1] Members of our community and many of you are full of statements Dan help me paired with a life or career changing impact many of us benefited directly from Dan's generosity of time
01:34:07 [W1] from Dan's generosity of time and thoughtfulness
01:34:13 [W1] Dan leaves behind his wife Julie and two young boys Adam and Ellis whom he loved dearly and many of you probably met at one of the many cncf events around the world.
01:34:28 [W1] This even more tragic is that Dan himself lost both his parents at roughly the same age as his boys are today to the AIDS pandemic.
01:34:38 [W1] This is why our Public Health effort was so important to him personally.
01:34:46 [W1] I was able to spend some time with Dan the week he passed and he wanted me to tell all of you how much he loved working with everyone in the open source community.
01:35:00 [W1] He was truly proud to have had the opportunity to help impact so many lives through his work and friendships in your world.
01:35:12 [W1] You know.
01:35:14 [W1] Today, it seems like the world is sick from so many things.
01:35:21 [W1] And while Dan didn't succeed in defeating his illness it was his wish that we carry on in the spirit of collaboration and generosity in establishing the Linux Foundation
01:35:36 [W1] As a shared resource not just to fight the covid-19 pandemic but to combat Future Health crisis.
01:35:45 [W1] In the end Dan wanted us all to see beyond each other's weaknesses and to work together in the spirit of love and kindness.
01:35:58 [W1] And we will honor his legacy by doing just that.
01:36:03 [W1] Not only in public health, but in all the important work all of you do together in open source.
01:36:13 [W1] We would like to support his family in this time of loss and secure a future for his boys college education.
01:36:21 [W1] For those of you who can contribute we've set up a site that you can contribute to the Dan con family education trust through the URL.
01:36:33 [W1] You see on your screen right now.
01:36:37 [W1] If you'd never rather not donate through that option A Family Trust is being set up that you would be able to contribute to directly and you can email the Linux Foundation to find out how to contribute there as well.
01:36:52 [W1] We encourage everybody to consider thanking Dan for his contributions by supporting his family.
01:37:01 [W1] I want to thank all of you so much.
01:37:03 [W1] this Stan
01:36:56 [W1] and on his behalf.
01:36:57 [W1] I want to express how much he cared for each and every one of you.
01:37:05 [W1] Thank you.
01:37:06 [W1] Good morning, Barcelona.
01:37:17 [W1] My name is Dan Khan and I am executive director of the cloud native Computing Foundation.
01:38:20 [W1] In the work that we're doing here together this week building on top of the shoulders of giants. Maybe neither Swift nor easy, but is also laying the foundations of the next generation of Innovations, which are even now being
01:38:35 [W1] half of kubernative
01:38:43 [W1] Thank you very much.
01:38:56 [W1] What an amazing tribute for an amazing man?
01:39:16 [W1] Hello, everyone. Welcome to coupon Cloud native con North America.
01:39:22 [W1] I'm Priyanka Sharma and I'm the general manager of the cloud native Computing Foundation.
01:39:28 [W1] It is my great pleasure to welcome you here Dan built this amazing ecosystem with all of us.
01:39:37 [W1] where the story of Team Cloud native a story of diversity powered resilience
01:39:43 [W1] And it is this diversity that makes us more resilient to weather any challenge.
01:39:46 [W1] Even the loss of a great leader.
01:39:50 [W1] As Dan grew this community diversity was at the Cornerstone of everything he built he changed the face of what tech conferences look like with inspirational coupon chairs and attendees from all kinds of backgrounds.
01:40:03 [W1] Just like all of you under his leadership and users became an official part of our ecosystem and we became a global movement.
01:40:15 [W1] Dance contribution to our world are many and to borrow from a well-known quote.
01:40:20 [W1] Dan was the man in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs who comes short again and again because there is no effort without error
01:40:35 [W1] Coming but who does actually strive to do the Deeds who knows great enthusiasms the great devotions who spends himself in a worthy cause who at best knows in the end the Triumph
01:40:49 [W1] Achievement and who at worst if he fails at least fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid Souls who neither know Victory nor defeat.
01:40:56 [W1] That is the standard dance at for us and we will not let him down.
01:41:01 [W1] team Cloud native I say we are the ones in the arena we will fight on and keep building the technology the community and the stories that Dan laid the foundation for
01:41:14 [W1] 2020 has thrown a lot at us.
01:41:17 [W1] But these are the kind of challenges that open source and Cloud native were built for our resilience comes from are far-reaching diverse Community. Dan worked tirelessly to diversify not only our
01:41:32 [W1] the den lead the foundation for
01:41:34 [W1] 2020 has thrown a lot at us.
01:41:36 [W1] But these are the kind of challenges that open source and Cloud native were built for our resilience comes from are far-reaching diverse Community. Dan worked tirelessly to diversify not only our
01:42:08 [W1] But also our Geographic reach and the end users we so who in turn Dutch hundreds of millions of consumers with their products and services.
01:42:19 [W1] It is my commitment to you that we will double down on those efforts those efforts to innovate more faster better by unleashing and enabling the power of a diverse Foundation of doors.
01:42:34 [W1] In order to do so we need to hold ourselves to the highest standards of inclusion.
01:42:41 [W1] Unfortunately, our ethos is not always reflected in our code.
01:42:47 [W1] To date offensive terminology such as Master Slave and whitelist Blacklist exists in our code bases the kubernative community recognized this and has already made big changes.
01:43:02 [W1] Building upon their work in the kubernative naming working group and partnering with industry France such as IBM and red hat and many others. We have kicked off across organizational corroboration focused on inclusive naming in
01:43:17 [W1] The goal of the initiative is to help motivated projects and organizations to effectively change manage to better terminology.
01:43:28 [W1] When it comes to diversity and inclusion open source has broken the barriers we call borders.
01:43:35 [W1] The cloud native Community is no exception Dan after all right Cube, gone2asia pack and under his leadership cncf welcomed both members and projects from the region.
01:43:47 [W1] Today, I am thrilled to welcome volcano engine by byte dance a global company based in China to cncf as a platinum member.
01:43:57 [W1] Let's learn more about them from their VP doctors.
01:44:02 [W1] Jinjiang joining us from Beijing. Machina engine is an Enterprise class service platform lunch by the Chinese technology company by dance. We have more than
01:44:17 [W1] than employees across a hundred and fifty countries are apps including the total content platform and the dough in video sharing social network support 75 different languages and our amount the most popular in
01:44:32 [W1] - of countries we have been a very heavy user of clown 80s knowledge is for a long time violence for example uses containers to manage half a million physical machines across tens of data centers.
01:44:34 [W1] All of our apps have been built on top of microservices and servicemeshcon deeply know the value of cloudevents acknowledge. He's in a secondly part of vicuna engine strategy is to place a lot of emphasis
01:44:49 [W1] Developer echo system and a community. We want to open source our own Technologies around things like clown ATIV storage and a cloud native machine learning.
01:44:48 [W1] We want to impact the developer community and a cncf is one of the top communities in this domain.
01:44:56 [W1] So that's the right channel to draw.
01:44:59 [W1] I definitely agree with that. Thank you for joining us June.
01:45:06 [W1] Asia is not the only place in brazing Cloud native.
01:45:10 [W1] The Passion of our community connects dots across many parts of the globe take for instance Kasten a start-up in the San Francisco Bay area that was recently acquired by VM and international company in the data protection
01:45:25 [W1] So that's the right channel to draw.
01:45:20 [W1] I definitely agree with that. Thank you for joining us June.
01:45:27 [W1] Asia is not the only place embracing Cloud native.
01:45:31 [W1] The Passion of our community connects dots across many parts of the globe take for instance Kasten a start-up in the San Francisco Bay area that was recently acquired by VM and international company in the data production space.
01:46:31 [W1] The US and Switzerland today, they are upgrading to a platinum membership their general manager nearish. Talia has joined me here today.
01:46:41 [W1] Let's learn from him about why Kasten by VM is doubling down on cncf of you who don't already know us Gaston is the market leader for kubernative data management.
01:46:53 [W1] We make it very easy for more developers and operators to run stateful qualitative applications by providing a powerful kubernative knative.
01:47:01 [W1] The platform for backup disaster recovery and cross cluster and cross Cloud application were billeted. The recently. We were a startup that in fact emerge from stuff that who conned in 2017 given what we owe to this community increasing our support for cncf.
01:47:16 [W1] After a recent acquisition by me as an extremely important with easy decision to make and also shows the commitment to the broader ecosystem looking forward as exciting as things are today.
01:47:27 [W1] I believe that we still have a great in front of us.
01:47:30 [W1] I remember my first group called Seattle in 2016.
01:47:33 [W1] And even though cloudevents Knology adoption is taken of that. He sticks instead.
01:47:38 [W1] We will look back at the news very fond memories of what will still feel like the early days.
01:47:44 [W1] Given how important developers and big application Centric is to everything that we do at Kasten.
01:47:50 [W1] I'm also looking forward to seeing the team for engage even further with both the community and cncf during this period of upcoming growth to everyone out there. Thank you so much for having us.
01:48:02 [W1] Thank you for your support neeraj.
01:48:05 [W1] As gin and neeraja have shared these new memberships are in a march to our community our technology and its promise for end-users.
01:48:15 [W1] This ecosystem is so Diversified after all we built the ship on kubernative and its success enabled knative manded a constellation of projects to support modernizing applications.
01:48:31 [W1] This ecosystem is so Diversified after all we built the ship on kubernative and its success enabled knative manded a constellation of projects to support modernizing applications.
01:48:46 [W1] Today many of our 70 plus projects are used in tandem by our end users to meet their diverse Cloud native needs for example cncf host the vitess project, which is a database clustering system for
01:49:10 [W1] my SQL
01:49:12 [W1] and use a company HubSpot uses vitess to run a hundred percent off their my SQL clusters on top of kubernative processing a hundred plus terabytes of data.
01:49:26 [W1] Another end-user company pay it provides a digital platform for government agencies think digital DMV after adopting kubernative Prometheus Envoy and fluent e paid reduce their infrastructure
01:49:41 [W1] and percent of Revenue
01:49:43 [W1] that is cloud native at its finest as you can see our end users are changing the world.
01:49:51 [W1] And many of you are sitting in the audience in your own homes today.
01:49:56 [W1] That's why and user-driven open source is so inspiring today workloads are run at a scale never seen before managing complexity.
01:50:07 [W1] None of us has ever experienced establishing a direct feedback loop between our end users and projects has been invaluable and further diversifies team Cloud native. We thank you and users for taking the
01:50:21 [W1] Time and effort and we promise to continue to build and user-driven open source here in Cloud native with you.
01:50:29 [W1] And as you have told us security concerns rise to the top of the metaphorical stack as you bring Cloud native Pilots to production fear not team Cloud native is here to support earlier this year.
01:50:43 [W1] We announced a new certification certified kubernative security specialist or cks.
01:50:49 [W1] The cks is a performance-based exam today.
01:50:53 [W1] I'm excited to announce that registration for cks is officially open. If you're an end-user company, this certification will help you train and certify your developers for the working knowledge of container security.
01:51:07 [W1] Ready concerns rise to the top of the metaphorical stack as you bring Cloud native Pilots to production fear. Not team Cloud native is here to support earlier this year.
01:51:14 [W1] We announced a new certification certified kubernative security specialist or cks. The cks is a performance-based exam today.
01:51:24 [W1] I'm excited to announce that registration for cks is officially open.
01:51:29 [W1] If you're an end-user company, this certification will help you train and certify your developers with a working knowledge of container security.
01:51:39 [W1] I encourage you to invest in your developers and support their Journey from devops to Dub Sack ups with the cks resilience comes in many forms diversifying skill sets is one of them.
01:51:54 [W1] Finally, let's talk about a diversity not often discussed that of workloads different verticals have unique requirements and as the cloud native ecosystem has matured it is now positioned to address these needs.
01:52:09 [W1] Two of the most demanding verticals that are also critical to our lives are Telco. S' and Edge Computing the cloud native ecosystem has kicked off a cloud native Network function working group to Define Telco workloads
01:52:24 [W1] Different verticals have unique requirements and as the cloud native ecosystem has matured it is now positioned to address these needs.
01:52:33 [W1] Two of the most demanding verticals that are also critical to our lives our Telco s' and Edge computing.
01:52:41 [W1] The cloud native ecosystem has kicked off Cloud native Network function working group to Define Telco workloads based on kubernative.
01:52:51 [W1] If this is something you care about please attend our CNF working group kickoff on Thursday to learn more and participate.
01:53:00 [W1] On The Edge front I'm excited to announce that Cox Communications shares our vision of bringing Cloud native to the edge and is joining the cncf as a gold member Cox is the largest private Broadband company
01:53:15 [W1] Serving homes and businesses with critical connectivity and solutions.
01:53:21 [W1] Cox is investing in educator abilities and looks forward to partnering with developers across the ecosystem in delivering cloud services and low latency performance to their residential and business customers.
01:53:34 [W1] We are thrilled to have them on board as a member and look forward to working with them in the coming year.
01:53:42 [W1] When I think about all of this great work, I've been with pride pride at all of our efforts Pride at the resilience. We have shown in this challenging year.
01:53:55 [W1] In all of the tributes, I read about Dan everyone shared how kind and caring he was and I experienced the same with him.
01:54:05 [W1] He was a Visionary with a gentle soul.
01:54:07 [W1] Someone who always wanted to see how he could help improve the lives of others.
01:54:14 [W1] Let's live our lives by his example.
01:54:18 [W1] Let's find the time to say hello to someone who may be churning out PRS and could use a break.
01:54:25 [W1] Let's reach out to someone who may have gone dark and see if they need a helping hand.
01:54:30 [W1] How kind and caring he was and I experienced the same with him.
01:54:30 [W1] He was a Visionary with a gentle soul.
01:54:32 [W1] Someone who always wanted to see how he could help improve the lives of others.
01:54:39 [W1] Let's live our lives by his example.
01:54:43 [W1] Let's find the time to say hello to someone who may be churning out PRS and could use a break.
01:54:50 [W1] Let's reach out to someone who may have gone dark and see if they need a helping hand.
01:54:56 [W1] I don't want anyone to ever doubt even for a minute that there is a place for them here in team Cloud near the answer is always yes, because diversity powered resilience is what
01:55:42 [W1] Is what open source and Cloud native are all about the webinar live us inclusive connected and stronger because of it.
01:55:52 [W1] Resilience is built not born our open source way of doing.
01:56:15 [W1] Will build ever more resilience in our companies in our organizations in our society. We are on the brink of change across borders and certainly in the United States.
01:56:28 [W1] Our diversity our openness. Our differences will power.
01:56:37 [W1] Untold Innovation Innovation that matters Innovation that makes end-users more efficient productive and creative and Innovation that ultimately adds value to the life of every single human being
01:56:54 [W1] Team Cloud native dancer has on the staff and now it's on us.
01:56:59 [W1] I say to you today make the most of Kube con Cloud knative coins, and this amazing community that is gathered here. Go engage with each other learn from the sessions be inspired and go do great things.
01:57:13 [W1] Innovation that matters Innovation that makes end users more efficient productive and creative and Innovation that ultimately adds value to the life of every single human being team
01:58:26 [W1] Hey, so my last conversation with Dan was actually around joining as a cube conch are and whether or not I'd be up for it.
01:58:37 [W1] And I think that you know overall just thinking about all of the things that have been said about Dan about the community about what he has started and what we continue to carry forward is huge.
01:58:52 [W1] The the impact that was made and the opportunities that have been given to so many people in the cloud native space to do great work and to get together and deliver and just be a cloud native family.
01:59:06 [W1] think is what is what Rings true out of out of everything, you know for me. I'm going to going to the memorial and just hearing everything the Dan has been a part of makes me think about like how we can
01:59:22 [W1] How we can think bigger right?
01:59:24 [W1] I feel like I'm just getting started in terms of like thinking big and learning how to lead.
01:59:30 [W1] So so I think that's what I take away from his his legacy trying to be better trying to deliver you a great conference trying to to do to do better for everyone.
01:59:42 [W1] So, thank you Steven.
01:59:49 [W1] Yeah, I think.
01:59:52 [W1] If you know me, I'm not really good on my feet.
01:59:54 [W1] And so I'll be definitely paraphrasing a lot of people said but
02:00:01 [W1] alright this pretty much sort of say like thank you Dan for getting us here and like for planting the seeds for where we can locally won't go and that
02:00:16 [W1] You Steven?
02:00:15 [W1] Yeah, I think.
02:00:18 [W1] If you know me, I'm not really good on my feet.
02:00:20 [W1] And so I'll be definitely paraphrasing a lot of people said but
02:00:27 [W1] right this pretty much sort of say like thank you Dan for getting us here and like for planting the seeds for where we can locally will go and
02:00:40 [W1] that
02:00:42 [W1] you know, it's like it's our homework and you know should be your takeaway is that we should all try to emulate, you know, his kindness his compassion and you know his energy and values to continue to make this community, you know to continue to
02:01:00 [W1] it's our homework and you know should be your takeaways that we should all try to emulate, you know, his kindness is compassion and you know his energy and values to continue to make this community, you know to continue to grow this community because
02:01:15 [W1] Testament to over the past few years I Austin was my first conference and I think I was like two 4,000 people and if this were to be in person who had been meant for what we're estimating almost 15,000 people read That's and that's just in person, right?
02:01:30 [W1] Showing how much is community is grown is direct, you know is from Dan's hard work and so we should all continue to emulate his energy and values and thank you Dan for everything you've done for me personally and for the community.
02:01:47 [W1] So our next presenter is is Cheryl hung Cheryl's a director of ecosystem at the cloud native Computing foundation. And today she's going to give you some updates on the cncf end-user ecosystem, please welcome Cheryl hung.
02:02:13 [W1] Hi everyone, and welcome to keep calm Cloud native calm.
02:02:16 [W1] This is Cheryl hung and I'm very excited to be joining you here from my kitchen.
02:02:23 [W1] She's going to give you some updates on the cncf end user ecosystem, please welcome Cheryl hung.
02:02:41 [W1] Hi everyone, and welcome to keep calm Cloud native calm.
02:02:44 [W1] This is Cheryl hung and I'm very excited to be joining you here from my kitchen.
02:02:57 [W1] But there's somebody who should be here and who isn't and that's Dan Kohn my previous manager one of the founders and executive director of the cncf when I recorded my keynote a few weeks ago.
02:03:11 [W1] None of us knew that he was going to leave us so soon.
02:03:14 [W1] So I wanted to share memory with you first and that's the very first
02:03:58 [W1] Hi everyone, and welcome to keep calm Cloud native come this is Cheryl hung and I'm very excited to be joining you here from my kitchen.
02:04:08 [W1] But there's somebody who should be here and who isn't and that's Dan Kohn my previous manager one of the founders and executive director of the cncf when I recorded my keynote a few weeks ago.
02:04:21 [W1] None of us knew that he was going to leave us so soon.
02:04:25 [W1] So I wanted to share memory with you first and that's the very first time that I spoke to Dan while I was interviewing for cncf.
02:04:34 [W1] But there's somebody who should be here and who isn't and that's done cone.
02:04:39 [W1] my previous manager one of the founders and executive director of the cncf when I recorded my keynote a few weeks ago. None of us knew that he was going to leave us so soon. So I wanted to share memory with you first
02:05:03 [W1] And then he when he picked up the phone to me.
02:05:06 [W1] The first thing he said to me was Cheryl.
02:05:11 [W1] After cncf, you could become the executive director of your own Foundation or you could start a start-up or you could become a VC or you could join one of our member companies and I was so surprised because I was like, aren't I
02:05:26 [W1] You why I'm good enough to do this job.
02:05:28 [W1] Why are you talking about?
02:05:29 [W1] What should happen after I do cncf, but that's how he thought about people and that's how he thought about the community.
02:05:37 [W1] It was never about.
02:05:38 [W1] Are you good enough to do it today?
02:05:41 [W1] He was always about how can I set you up so that in the future you'll be even better and you'll have even more opportunities to do what you want to do for that.
02:05:50 [W1] I'm very grateful and I know many of you who knew Dan are also very grateful.
02:05:57 [W1] And in the spirit of that I'm going to spend the rest of my keynote talking about the training and certification and education upskilling yourself and your team's but I just wanted to say thank you Dan we all miss you.
02:06:19 [W1] Hello everyone and welcome to keep Concord knative Khan.
02:06:22 [W1] I'm Cheryl and I've got two really exciting announcements from cncf certification. One is a new certified kubernative security Specialists. And the second is new training benefits for end user companies.
02:06:35 [W1] All Cube con attendees get a discount on certifications.
02:06:39 [W1] So I wanted to help you understand whether you should spend your time getting certified. Let's talk about
02:06:46 [W1] Three questions who should take certifications?
02:06:50 [W1] What do they cover?
02:06:51 [W1] First who should take certifications certifications are good for many different audiences. According to the 2020 open source jobs reports fund. The Linux Foundation devops is the most sought-after job
02:07:03 [W1] A five percent of companies looking to hire more devops talent and the average salary for a kubernative job in the u.s. Is a hundred and forty eight thousand dollars.
02:07:00 [W1] We've got over 19. Everyone has way more time at home than normal and we have seen incredible growth incredible demand for training and certification 68% of professionals told us that they plan to
02:07:15 [W1] This year which is up significantly from 47 percent in 2018.
02:07:19 [W1] For hiring managers, obviously a certification is not the same as real world experience.
02:07:24 [W1] I definitely know this because when I was a devops manager back in 2017, it was just basically impossible to find anyone with experience running kubernative in production.
02:07:37 [W1] So doing interviews, I would you know, look for cloud native mindset that says person think about releasing frequently.
02:07:43 [W1] Do they think about monitoring their life systems do they think about automation?
02:07:49 [W1] Remember had one really memorable answer to this one candidate said we build our software using containers and Jenkins.
02:07:57 [W1] Okay, all sounds pretty good so far and then we burn our software to DVDs and we ship those DVDs out and I just had this mind-blowing moment because while we have come a long way
02:08:13 [W1] Shipping DVDs through the mail to what people expect nowadays from software and a huge part of that is thanks to the many contributors who have put their time into Cloud native projects a third audience for certification.
02:08:25 [W1] Cloud native projects a third audience for certifications is end users those who are adopting kubenetes and they want to establish a baseline of knowledge across existing teams 74% of hiring managers
02:08:33 [W1] What would need to pay for certifications and one told me we chose to pursue the CK and cked training classes as a way to provide an educational foundation for wide swath of software and platform engineer's
02:08:48 [W1] kubenetes, and is ecosystem
02:08:50 [W1] Kubernative is our main infrastructure platform, and we wanted to set up a kubernative baseline of knowledge for SRE and application engineers.
02:08:59 [W1] And we chose CK and CKD as a community validated approach.
02:09:04 [W1] So what at second question, what do the certifications cover CK a stands for certified kubernative administrator and CKD for certified kubenetes application developer and we
02:09:19 [W1] It to launch the third in the series that is the C KS or certified kubenetes security specialist and it's going to cover six topics cluster set up cost a hardening system hardening minimizing
02:09:33 [W1] Supply chain security monitoring logging and runtime security, but where did these six topics come from?
02:09:36 [W1] So let me tell you this is John Foreman.
02:09:40 [W1] He is a senior technical architecture manager at Accenture and over the last two years.
02:09:45 [W1] He had seen a shift in client questions from what our containers to how do we secure containers and to him that disconnect was because current security tools were not
02:09:58 [W1] Nowhere, so although teams were good at monitoring servers operating systems and network layers.
02:10:04 [W1] The container clusters just consistently went unmonitored.
02:10:08 [W1] So John and his team had been working on this container security reference model for Dev seccomp engineer's which he wanted to share out with the rest of the community.
02:10:19 [W1] So John and I we had a coffee and Q concern Diego and he asked whether cncf would create a new security Focus.
02:10:27 [W1] Ian which would be the gold standard for when companies hire Talent OR encourage their current staff to get certified and I said, yeah, that sounds great because I've also seen the same growing demand for container security
02:10:43 [W1] Open source jobs report degrees after Cloud Technologies and Linux security is the third highest priority knowledge area, but this certification has to be community-driven because it has to reflect security practices across
02:10:57 [W1] please so thanks to Sig security 20 Security Experts from vendors consultancies and end-users volunteer to come together and they discuss the most important tasks that a security specialist
02:11:01 [W1] And that's where these six topics came from and I want to say a huge.
02:11:05 [W1] thank you to John his team and our Security Experts for contributing your time and your expertise to the community because to answer the question of what do certifications cover its the community duh the
02:11:20 [W1] Is decides what is most important last question?
02:11:22 [W1] Is this a fair test?
02:11:24 [W1] And do you need real skills to pass it?
02:11:26 [W1] Well, there's only one way to find out.
02:11:28 [W1] I think I'm going to go and try it myself.
02:11:31 [W1] So let's go over to a laptop.
02:11:36 [W1] Alright, so the first thing that I see here is that it's not QA.
02:11:42 [W1] I actually have a live cluster and a live terminal that I can type into so I'm told that I need to set the configuration context before I start.
02:11:50 [W1] I'm just going to copy and paste that looks like I can switch to the kubernetes context and I am given a task here.
02:11:59 [W1] So my task is to find the pods running on any nodes having a memory limit configured and write the name of
02:12:06 [W1] Pollard with the highest memory limit configured to this file / up / whatever whatever. So my first task I'm going to look at the cluster and look at the nodes with Cube CTL get nodes.
02:12:23 [W1] It's like this is a three node cluster.
02:12:25 [W1] I have kubernative Master zero kubernative node 0 and kubernative Node 1 the next step for me.
02:12:33 [W1] me I think is to look for the pods that are running on each node.
02:12:38 [W1] I'm actually going to pause here and ask what would you do and we'll come back to this solution at the end.
02:12:45 [W1] Configured to this file / up, / whatever whatever. So my first task I'm going to look at the cluster and look at the nodes with Cube CTL get nodes.
02:12:57 [W1] It's like this is a three node cluster.
02:12:59 [W1] I have kubernative Master zuo kubernative node 0 and kubenetes Node 1. The next step for me. I think is to look for the pods that are running on each node.
02:13:12 [W1] I'm actually going to pause here and ask what would you do and we'll come back to this solution at the end.
02:13:21 [W1] So to me, I actually do feel like this is a fair test because you have to be comfortable with a command line with Cube CTL and other tools that are sysadmin would typically use over 15,000 people who have already completed the cka or CKD.
02:13:50 [W1] Me I actually do feel like this is a fair test because you have to be comfortable with a command line with Cube CTL and other tools that are sysadmin would typically use over 15,000 people who have already completed the cka or CKD
02:14:11 [W1] People ugly.
02:14:12 [W1] It's pretty hard one.
02:14:43 [W1] Said we think specifications really valuable and I'll Engineers found the training and exam approach fair and practical as its Performance Based not theoretical so to sum up is it worth getting a certification?
02:14:59 [W1] The company said it best no training is perfect.
02:15:01 [W1] It's not going to make an engineer an expert after 1 week of training but the Hands-On exercises help build muscle memory, which engineer's can leverage in their day-to-day responsibilities, and we want to encourage more people to get certified.
02:15:17 [W1] so all que con attendees get 50% off if you register this week making it $150 instead of $300 and I'm personally really excited to announce new training benefits for end users if your
02:15:26 [W1] Upton kubenetes and you plan to certify a whole team you should join cncf as an end-user member because you're going to get an unlimited training subscription for 15 users +15 exam vouchers for value of up
02:15:35 [W1] Dollars or you can join as an end-user supporter and get 5 training courses or certifications for value of up to $2,500.
02:15:43 [W1] So if you're currently adopting kubernative and you want to improve the training and education options for your team go to cncf dot IO / join.
02:15:55 [W1] Last but not least the solution.
02:15:57 [W1] I didn't forget. So let's go back to the laptop.
02:16:04 [W1] Alright, so here we go. Again. Remember my task was to find the pods on any nodes with the highest memory limit and write the name of the Pod to this file.
02:16:15 [W1] So I already know this is a three node cluster.
02:16:20 [W1] I'm going to do Cube CTL describe node, and look at what is running on each of these nodes.
02:16:29 [W1] Looks like the first one it's called DNS it CD in a bunch of cube Cube containers.
02:16:37 [W1] And the one with the highest memory limit is the core DNS pods with a hundred and seventy. I'm going to do the same again for the kubernative node 0
02:16:52 [W1] do I see anything with more than 170?
02:16:57 [W1] Nope?
02:16:58 [W1] Okay.
02:16:58 [W1] And same again.
02:16:59 [W1] I don't see anything higher than a hundred seventy.
02:17:01 [W1] So if I remember correctly, this is actually a tie there were two pods which both have a hundred and seventy as a memory limit of a hundred seventy.
02:17:10 [W1] Let me take these and I'm going to Echo these into the
02:17:20 [W1] the file that I was told to
02:17:24 [W1] so looks like I've got one and then the second one.
02:17:40 [W1] Okay, and just to confirm that I actually did do it.
02:17:45 [W1] Let me use cats to check this file.
02:17:50 [W1] And yeah all is good.
02:17:52 [W1] Did you get it right if you got it right then well done.
02:17:56 [W1] Happy certifying and have a fantastic people.
02:18:08 [W1] Thank you so much Cheryl next up. We have Alina / her check.
02:18:13 [W1] She is a software engineer at apple and a member of the cncf technical oversight committee.
02:18:20 [W1] And today she'll be sharing some some of apples Journey.
02:18:24 [W1] All is good.
02:18:12 [W1] Did you get it right if you got it right then well done.
02:18:16 [W1] Happy certifying and have a fantastic View.
02:18:28 [W1] Thank you so much Cheryl next up. We have Alina / her Chuck.
02:18:33 [W1] She is a software engineer at apple and a member of the cncf technical oversight committee. And today she'll be sharing some some of apples Journey.
02:18:44 [W1] It's a cloud native, which I'm super excited about, please welcome Elena.
02:19:04 [W1] Hello everyone.
02:19:05 [W1] My name is Alina and I work for Apple.
02:19:07 [W1] I joined the company as a software engineer about a year ago to work on kubernative and Cloud native projects since then so many people from the open source Community have asked me what attracted me the most to my new job and the answer is easy.
02:19:33 [W1] Hello everyone.
02:19:34 [W1] My name is Alina and I work for Apple.
02:19:37 [W1] I joined the company as a software engineer about a year ago to work on kubernative and Cloud native projects since then so many people from the open source Community have asked me what attracted me the most to my new job and the answer is easy.
02:19:56 [W1] The cloud infrastructure and the variety of applications running on it before I mainly focus on kubenetes clusters provisioning.
02:20:04 [W1] I thought that looking at things from the application and end user and got scale would help to complete the circle.
02:20:10 [W1] So here I am.
02:20:12 [W1] When you join a new team or company getting to know its history helps to understand current decisions and trade-offs measures has been used at Apple for over five years with an internally build container orchestrator called grpc.
02:20:25 [W1] It had a good reputation as a scheduling platform and it's killed well to support multiple Frameworks for running a variety of services like by stateful and stateless, but the container orchestrator soon became a bottleneck for
02:20:40 [W1] And so we started considering other choices.
02:20:43 [W1] In addition to masses Apple use some other solutions for compute management along with the transition. We wanted to consolidate them and provide the unified platform for better capacity utilization.
02:20:54 [W1] We found that kubernative was an obvious winner as an orchestrator.
02:21:01 [W1] With kubernative being more generic in pluggable.
02:21:04 [W1] it meant we could better divide work mountains the decisions on what provider to choose four core components like storage in time and network.
02:21:13 [W1] We're no longer life or death decisions.
02:21:15 [W1] We knew that it was just a plug-in choice and the choice could always be re-evaluated without refactoring the entire system.
02:21:22 [W1] Another big point of Attraction for developers was an ability to extend kubernative zp eyes and core functionality by leveraging cri-o.
02:21:31 [W1] And custom controllers the kubernative community was a huge asset to the platform its transparency and power was so obvious and provided a great level of comfort to developers.
02:21:44 [W1] The goal was to meet the demand of diverse user.
02:21:48 [W1] Please we had teams who were already successfully running kubernative clusters in their organization and we had people who had never worked with kubernetes before but trusted the technology and wanted to adopt it when the change of this magnitude
02:22:04 [W1] The communities Community was a huge asset to the platform its transparency and power was so obvious and provided a great level of comfort to Developers.
02:22:09 [W1] The goal was to meet the demand of diverse user.
02:22:14 [W1] Peace we had teams who were already successfully running kubernative clusters in their organization, and we had people who had never worked with kubernetes before but trusted the technology and wanted to adopted when the change of this magnitude
02:22:47 [W1] it is important to be honest about
02:23:07 [W1] the trade-offs that need to be made for successful migration.
02:23:12 [W1] It is a known fact that kubernative learning curve is steep. Not only for end users but for platform developers to
02:23:20 [W1] All the platform features that were built in the past had to be re-evaluated is the features current design aligned with the cloud native best practices.
02:23:29 [W1] is this feature even relevant to the new platform asking and answering these questions can be uncomfortable for people and software is built by people.
02:23:39 [W1] We had to accept the fact that there would be a need for a change to the current processes and people would have to adapt
02:23:47 [W1] we realized the impact of the decision. We were ready to invest in training resources and provide full support for developers anything to make that option successful at that point with the net is became our platform choice for compute management terrible.
02:24:03 [W1] Our Target goal is to make the majority of Apple workloads run on kubernative.
02:24:08 [W1] And software is built by people.
02:24:10 [W1] We had to accept the fact that there would be a need for a change to the current processes and people would have to adapt.
02:24:18 [W1] We realized the impact of the decision.
02:24:20 [W1] We were ready to invest in training resources and provide full support for developers anything to make that option successful at that point with the net is became our platform choice for compute management at Apple.
02:24:34 [W1] Our Target goal is to make the majority of Apple workloads run on kubernative.
02:24:39 [W1] We want to maintain end-user Focus while building the platform that required us to understand and categorize our platform users to establish common patterns for hardware and software infrastructure planning.
02:24:54 [W1] One category of users are Java python go developers who want to test and run their applications in the containers. Another category are applications s eries whose focus is on building Advanced deployment workflows for their teams.
02:25:24 [W1] for structure planning
02:25:26 [W1] one category of users are Java python go developers who want to test and run their applications in the containers?
02:25:33 [W1] Another category are applications s eries whose focus is on building Advanced deployment workflows for their teams.
02:25:41 [W1] Another example is hard work. We engineer's who are not afraid to try new things and explore Creative Solutions using Cloud native tools anything to make it easier for Hardware teams to validate devices.
02:25:55 [W1] their machine learning and watch workloads Engineers who utilize the plot from daily running thousands of but jobs that use both CPU and GPU use for training machine learning models Finance is also a platform user as they're a big part of placement decisions and
02:26:10 [W1] Neighing all of this users want to adopt Cloud native tools for better debugging logging monitoring and tracing for their apps.
02:26:18 [W1] Our responsibility as flowed from developers is to provide a scalable artist raishin layer.
02:26:24 [W1] secure resource isolation and reliable scheduling building high level abstractions and CLI tools is also necessary for the plot from success and adoption.
02:26:36 [W1] So we have this big infrastructure pool of compute and storage resources managed by Kudo. Nerys providing it to users can be done in two ways cluster has a service and namespace as a service.
02:26:50 [W1] namespace is a service is our primary model today as I re managers multi-tenant kubernative clusters and user appears in one or multiple namespaces.
02:27:01 [W1] This way users do not have an overhead of infrastructure management and configuration.
02:27:06 [W1] Focus on application deployment and development.
02:27:09 [W1] However, we realize that in the world workloads Structural Engineering has been commodified some teams may still want cluster as a service.
02:27:19 [W1] With a goal of centralized capacity control we had to obstruct Resource Management to its own system. We wanted to make it as G Eric as possible to streamline the solution for the hybrid cloud in the future.
02:27:31 [W1] That is provided to users can be done in two ways cluster as a service and namespace as a service namespaces a service is our primary model today as I re managers multi-tenant kubernative
02:29:55 [W1] Location resource isolation would be handled by assigning priority and quarter to each workloads.
02:30:15 [W1] Even with a namespace as a service constraints we wanted users to have a freedom to choose Cloud native tools to run in there namespaces. Some of these tools require crd is a cluster level resource.
02:30:27 [W1] We had to think of a proper ci/cd management flow to make the deployment possible.
02:30:33 [W1] Solving this technical challenges would not have been possible without the wide array of cloud native tools those we use on the platform level and those who recommend to application Developers.
02:30:44 [W1] This list is not complete.
02:32:13 [W1] And keeps on growing as we constantly evaluate new projects and find more areas for development and integration.
02:32:21 [W1] With all the careful planning only running things at scale could reveal certain issues.
02:32:26 [W1] We have chosen open source, kubernative probe test cluster Lauder to the challenge. Our cluster is developers can always write their own framework, but we found cluster elotl been quite profile. We wanted to engage more with the
02:32:41 [W1] As time and fixing and expanding the existing tool that could be used by others.
02:32:37 [W1] Another area of emitted Focus was scheduling we run mixed types of workloads and kubernative including Bosch workloads and want to maintain a reasonable resource utilization participating in six scheduling and contributing back is very important to
02:32:52 [W1] You want to stay as close to the Upstream as possible for some people in our team.
02:32:46 [W1] It was their very first experience contributing to Upstream kubernative going through the process of joining sick for discussions filing first, kubernative these issues and recognizing the various ways to help the community. It was all new and exciting.
02:33:00 [W1] I would like to share some of our current priorities.
02:33:04 [W1] In a multi-tenant environment many customers workloads around on the same machine to meet security requirements and provide isolation between mix level of trust a common pattern is to leverage defense in depth.
02:33:18 [W1] We are seeking to enable this level of isolation with micro VMS with that multiple untrusting tenants can run on the same notes and share the same control plane while continuing to provide two layers of isolation virtual machine and
02:33:33 [W1] Plus there is a certain is comes to the cost of increased Security Management resource utilization in efficiency and operational burden in the company's of Apple scale as a result.
02:33:44 [W1] We started exploring alternative models like virtual clusters with virtual cluster user self services virtualized kubernative control and data plane on top of shared kubernative infrastructure.
02:33:56 [W1] eliminates the majority of security and attritional concerns.
02:34:01 [W1] With the deployment footprint growth and distribution cross data centers comes the demand for multi cluster workloads management.
02:34:09 [W1] We are researching on API haproxy solution offer improved self healing utilization efficiency high level abstractions and developer workflow experiences for teams that manage workloads across multiple clusters.
02:34:21 [W1] We want to reduce the plot from complexity for developers and operators at the same time. We want to maintain high security standards and low resource utilization.
02:34:31 [W1] So we are investing in function as a service solution leveraging server site webassembly to solve this.
02:34:38 [W1] With a constant editions of the new features and user workloads observability becomes one of the top priorities. We want to keep the platform management saying as the platform growth
02:34:50 [W1] And user productivity and happiness is our end goal.
02:35:46 [W1] Adopting new technology on such a big scale often comes hand in hand with organizational changes.
02:35:52 [W1] You need to change everything and everyone from managers and finance to tag teams and yourself.
02:35:59 [W1] It is a long road with a lot of growing pains our security team grew and took on extra responsibilities.
02:36:07 [W1] Ensuring security and multi-tenant cluster is not a trivial task.
02:36:11 [W1] Adopting new technology on such a big scale often comes hand in hand with organizational changes.
02:36:15 [W1] You need to change everything and everyone from managers and finance to tag teams and yourself.
02:36:21 [W1] It is a long road with a load of growing pains our security team grew and took on extra responsibilities.
02:36:30 [W1] Insurance security and multi-tenant cluster is not a trivial task.
02:36:33 [W1] We had to have a clear separation of concern between application security and kubernative platform security to maintain a shared responsibility model.
02:36:43 [W1] One of our goals was to rethink about City Planning having a dedicated resource management team working close with the finance department was necessary. Some new teams were formed some grew in size and responsibilities and some
02:37:00 [W1] security to maintain a shared responsibility model
02:37:04 [W1] One of our goals was to rethink about City Planning having a dedicated resource management team working close with the finance department was necessary. Some new teams were formed some grew in size and responsibilities and some
02:37:20 [W1] S every team used to be more operational and systems focused now, it has an emphasis on engineering and a much stronger voice in the platform architectural design having a solid and stable platform made it possible to maintain focus on the
02:37:35 [W1] and innovate Foster
02:37:37 [W1] Innovation is impossible without collaboration Forum in a cross team technical review board for cloud native based projects was invaluable to us.
02:37:46 [W1] It is a safe place to get peer feedback from people having different backgrounds.
02:37:52 [W1] Some have more experience with developing features for kubernative and some have a deep expertise in a particular technical domain like security getting their combined input is extremely useful during the design stage.
02:38:05 [W1] With a shared platform shared information becomes a necessity.
02:38:08 [W1] We are likely to have a dedicated team managing inner source and open source initiatives here at Apple the team focuses on internal trainings on cloud native and Kudo knative advises people who want to start making their first open source contributions
02:38:23 [W1] I'm cheered information becomes a necessity.
02:38:24 [W1] We are likely to have a dedicated team managing inner source and open source initiatives here at Apple the team focuses on internal trainings on cloud native and kubernative advises people who want to start making their first open source contributions
02:38:49 [W1] For those who have been contributing for to open source for a while.
02:38:54 [W1] The team helps to connect people and grow both internal and external collaborations.
02:39:01 [W1] The ongoing transformation leaves a very little time for reflection, but the reflection is always necessary migration is not something everyone wants to do but those who invest in the modernizing their application and the platform benefit in the future by
02:39:16 [W1] Loud knative technologists on top of the foundation.
02:39:19 [W1] Migration at scale has taught us to embrace the community best practices and shared learnings.
02:39:25 [W1] We wanted to give back and have realized that engagement comes in many forms writing code serving on Toc board for cncf helping kubernative release team improving documentation file in issues and many more
02:39:40 [W1] Engagement comes in many forms writing code serving on Toc board for cncf helping kubernative release team improving documentation file in issues and many more Innovation is driven by sharing and collaboration.
02:40:06 [W1] And is driven by sharing and collaboration sharing with the broader community in the open source sharing with another team in your company through the inner Source helps to enable reuse of existing Solutions and minimize the redundancy even
02:40:21 [W1] Helps to enable reuse of existing Solutions and minimize the redundancy. Even Small Change can begin to make larger cultural change a reality.
02:40:30 [W1] We have realized that in the end the migration changes not just a technical stackrox, but the people involved in it.
02:40:37 [W1] Please reach out to us if you have any questions, thank you.
02:40:47 [W1] Thank you Elena.
02:40:48 [W1] Just also for anyone who is new to this to Kook on especially since we can't do round of applause. Don't forget to do the virtual clapping within the slack Channel.
02:40:59 [W1] All right, so use those waves also Priyanka and Cheryl should definitely get a college as well since we haven't had a chance to give them a round of applause.
02:41:07 [W1] I also want to give all of you a round of applause for turning this into a low test.
02:41:13 [W1] all working on addressing.
02:41:17 [W1] Without pausing issues. So just let you know that we were seeing it and we are addressing it and we are working to get this back as soon as possible. And now for our next presenter, our next presenter is Diane Mueller.
02:41:30 [W1] She is the director of Community Development at red hat and today Diane will discuss the impact end users are making on open source and have a canoe sure that success please welcome Diane Mueller and give her a round of applause.
02:41:43 [W1] Red hat, and I'm really excited to be here today to talk with you about.
02:42:27 [W1] Hey everybody.
02:42:28 [W1] I'm Diane dealer and I'm the director of Community Development at red hat and I'm really excited to be here today to talk with you about end users and more specifically about the phenomenal rise in participation of end users in open source communities across the cloud native ecosystem in many ways. This is
02:42:43 [W1] her to end users in my way of expressing my virtual gratitude for all the many contributions that end users have made that have helped Drive Innovation into the projects and products and services that I and the rest of red hat have had the privilege to work on in collaboration
02:42:50 [W1] / in the audience today over the past years like many of you open source fuels my work. It gives me a mission allows me to contribute to make
02:42:59 [W1] the world a better place and hopefully to be a catalyst for others to participate and contribute to building a better world for all of us. We have barely scratched the surface of the eye.
02:45:00 [W1] opportunity that is ahead of us as we all know open source has a future and the rise in end user participation has enabled us to dramatically scale and accelerate what we're doing today to continue to do so, we need to evolve and nurture that
02:45:23 [W1] Virtuous end user cycle that Priyanka Sharma so eloquently pointed out at the last can comb and this will ensure all of our successes and help all of us grow. Our communities today end users are not just giving feedback.
02:45:36 [W1] They're building side by side with us. We have projects like metal cube that while it may have sprung from Red Hat now is key maintainers and dedicated engineering resources from Erickson working full-time to
02:45:57 [W1] Drive this project for we've seen major donations of fully formed projects and code bases such as Jaeger and Uber and Envoy from lift and backstage from Spotify and many more that are evidenced in the cncf landscape.
02:46:12 [W1] Red Hat now is key maintainers and dedicated engineering resources from Erickson working full-time to
02:46:26 [W1] Drive this project forward we've seen major donations of fully formed projects and code bases such as Jaeger and Uber and Envoy from lift and backstage from Spotify and many more that are evidenced in the cncf landscape.
02:46:40 [W1] that is literally bursting at the seams with projects filling the sandboxes and launching themselves and GitHub repos, and we're now seeing a new emerging trend of end users sharing up the stack and openly discussing their workloads and how they've implemented.
02:46:54 [W1] Such as with Telco is like America movil and their Enterprise neurosystem initiative in which they're sharing their AI Ops expertise and implementation to bring more efficiency to all of their Enterprises using the open source way.
02:47:08 [W1] They're taking Enterprise and Industry specific user groups to an entirely new level.
02:47:16 [W1] And while vendors continue including Red Hat divided to be seen as the top contributors and engineering resources dedicated to a cncf projects and believe me. We are all grateful for those continued contributions.
02:47:29 [W1] So please do all keep bracing for that Top Notch the real Trend that we should be proud of and to continue to nurture can be seen further down in the dev stats and the stack analytics and other dashboards is in the huge rise of
02:47:44 [W1] Actively participating in our working groups at all level I'd be hugely remiss if I didn't give a shout out and thank you to all the end-user participants in the openshift communities and especially those in the okd working group that are helping Drive the collaboration across
02:47:59 [W1] If I didn't give a shout out and thank you to the all the end-user participants in the openshift communities and especially those in the okd working group that are helping Drive the collaboration across openshift okd Fedora core OS and operators and lots of others.
02:48:14 [W1] Fedora core OS and operators and lots of others, you know, that's I'm hugely grateful for that and it wouldn't be possible without the end user participation and contributions.
02:48:27 [W1] There are now end users on the cncf TOC and on the board and in this and you can see them in the cncf end user Community initiatives and creating these spaces isn't hugely important to give them voice, but there's
02:48:42 [W1] It's more work to be done as not all end users and corporations are able to participate yet.
02:48:48 [W1] We've seen peer to peer coaching from those that are participating.
02:48:53 [W1] we've seen the rise of Enterprises launching their own open source program offices like at Salesforce and in at Apple and the creation of rules, like open source officers at Bosch
02:49:09 [W1] The more we can do to help or their organizations and their management teams understand the value of open information and Innovation the more resources they can bring to the party.
02:49:21 [W1] Projects like that of the cncf contributor to contributor Sig that's doing great work on creating clear pass from boarding participants into our communities need to be raised up and made more visible their work around embedding and creating clear
02:49:36 [W1] Unity's need to be raised up and made more visible their work around embedding and creating clear contribution letters ladders so that the path from newbie to maintain Andrews clear and open and inclusive
02:49:49 [W1] Many projects already have well-trodden well-documented pass like Helm and Envoy and now Porter's got a great one I call on all of the project leads out of our communities and others to revisit and talk to the end
02:50:04 [W1] Coming year to ensure their projects have well-documented paths or onboarding and growing their maintainers.
02:50:11 [W1] This will ensure the sustainability and health of all their efforts and all of our efforts open source open formats. Open Standards have not only changed technology.
02:50:20 [W1] They've also changed our society for good the role of end users in this cannot be understated by nurturing and making spaces for end users. We have the opportunity to accelerate this work at a greater scale and show
02:50:34 [W1] everyone that open really does unlock the world's potential.
02:50:40 [W1] So thank you.
02:50:41 [W1] We look forward to continuing to collaborate with all of you across the ecosystem.
02:50:45 [W1] Have a great coupon stay open. They safe be well.
02:50:55 [W1] Thank you so much Diane.
02:50:57 [W1] I love the message about the end user community and I hope to see more of you in and around Cloud native projects.
02:51:04 [W1] So next up we have constants.
02:51:07 [W1] my silly co-chair partner in crime for for promos and other things Constance is a principle software engineer at Splunk and she will be talking about cncf project updates today.
02:51:21 [W1] Take it away.
02:51:30 [W1] I'm Constance caramel has and I'll be doing your cncf project updates today.
02:51:36 [W1] Before we get started.
02:51:37 [W1] I want to talk a little bit about something. We're changing this time try and see how it goes as you'll notice during this Kook on cloud native con. There's an increased focus on telling end user stories and we're going to continue that theme here today during project updates.
02:51:50 [W1] Let's get started.
02:51:54 [W1] Our first project and talk about is Falco Falco is a runtime security project and it consumed signals from the Linux kernel and container management tools such as Doctrine kubernative Falco Parsons these signals and assert some again security rules.
02:52:09 [W1] Was violated our Learners triggered?
02:51:51 [W1] Now, let's look at some of the cool statistics that have happened in the past year.
02:51:56 [W1] One there have been over seven hundred thousand downloads of the kernel module in 10 days.
02:52:03 [W1] That's an amazing number 60 new contributors this year and these contributors come from companies like IBM covr Shopify AWS appdynamics in a team really wide variety of contributors. That's amazing.
02:52:20 [W1] There are 12 adopters and many independent users. Now what have been some updates to the project.
02:52:27 [W1] One is a user space driver additions such as support for fargate workloads using p dig support for armed 64 arm7.
02:52:36 [W1] Yes, that means lower energy processing.
02:52:41 [W1] Stability / improvements to the Falco engine for better performance additional Community Integrations such as Falco sidekick and a growing number of additional Community creations.
02:52:54 [W1] And there's been some user adoption improvements such as improved Helm charts Falco CTL vocal cuddle.
02:53:02 [W1] I'm going to need someone to correct that for me afterwards Falco exporter for Prometheus and Improvement generators event generators.
02:53:09 [W1] Gordon this is really wonderful to see in terms of end user.
02:53:08 [W1] I will not be able to do justice to shame Lawrence and Chris nóva if you didn't have a chance, I highly suggest for you to look to watch their keynote from EU Shane Lawrence comes from Shopify and he describes
02:53:24 [W1] What how Shopify uses Falco to give you the TLD W the too long didn't watch Shopify uses Falco and it's rule sets in production for detection and prevention.
02:53:20 [W1] It does things such as detecting data egress example coredns mining metadata server abuse and a remote code execution output.
02:53:29 [W1] Please check out their keynote. They will do much better description of how things are done. Thank you.
02:53:38 [W1] Shopify Shane Lawrence and Chris Nobles overdoing Kuma you and thank you Falco.
02:53:46 [W1] On to our next project Thanos Thanos is a Prometheus base scalable time series data base that provides a global query View High availability and data backup with historical cheap access as its core features all
02:54:01 [W1] single binary
02:54:04 [W1] they say it is three years old.
02:54:07 [W1] They have 281 contributors and direct quote from the maintainers.
02:54:11 [W1] They are very grateful for that.
02:54:12 [W1] Thank you contributors.
02:54:13 [W1] There are sixty five hundred stargazers and in 2020, they focus on mentoring.
02:54:21 [W1] They had nine students.
02:54:23 [W1] came from programs like cncf Community bridge and Google summer of code, and they had a really positive impact on the project. I'll mention one of their additions in a minute.
02:54:34 [W1] And they have high commit velocity over the past year.
02:54:37 [W1] They've been averaging six commits per day.
02:54:39 [W1] This is amazing.
02:54:40 [W1] This is a chart here on the right that I want to see for everyone.
02:54:44 [W1] This is just great work everyone.
02:54:47 [W1] What about some updates?
02:54:50 [W1] So we need to give us a nose around of Applause that virtual Round of Applause and sock everyone.
02:54:56 [W1] It has reached incubation status and April 20 20.
02:55:00 [W1] Congratulations Thanos community.
02:55:01 [W1] That is great work.
02:55:04 [W1] They've added support for knative response cache and collaboration with cortex project.
02:55:08 [W1] Another thing.
02:55:09 [W1] I want to highlight collaboration with other projects.
02:55:12 [W1] This makes me really happy to see it is, you know, we are all providing solutions for the cognitive world and seeing this collaboration just makes me really happy.
02:55:23 [W1] They've added new react you eyes to all components.
02:55:26 [W1] This is also a really big thank you to the community and to the mentees.
02:55:32 [W1] There is a heavy focus on analytics olap Integrations through absolute. Exclaim Unity sub-project.
02:55:39 [W1] There's offer full multi-tenancy. This allows for flexible deployment of various read storage and right tendency.
02:55:48 [W1] And the root of the limitation of from career prom cool single CPU concurrency and Prometheus.
02:55:53 [W1] That means it's multi-core.
02:55:56 [W1] It has sped up querying.
02:55:57 [W1] thank you Thanos. Let's talk about Rook.
02:56:04 [W1] Now we have to give Rook around of Applause. They graduated earlier this year.
02:56:12 [W1] Rook provides an open source storage solution for kubernative use through operators in C RDS. It automates management of storage providers including ceph NFS Cassandra cockroach DB and yugabyte DB.
02:56:27 [W1] There are over 7800 stargazers.
02:56:32 [W1] 295 contributors the ones you want me to say again.
02:56:36 [W1] Thank you to The Rook community maintainers.
02:56:41 [W1] Over a hundred eighty million downloads amazing.
02:56:45 [W1] And most recently there's really Savvy 1.5 and it contains improvements such as support for Stuff stretch clusters encryption with KMS and mirroring block data across clusters.
02:57:00 [W1] Now the next end-user I'm really excited about well, so because it's not, you know, we don't really hear so much about research and education use cases.
02:57:08 [W1] So the Pacific research platform project is a partnership across many many institutions both at the governmental level National Science Foundation Department of energy and also multiple research universities
02:57:23 [W1] In the United States and around the world.
02:57:25 [W1] So PRP aims to create a seamless research platform that encourages collaboration on a broad range of data intensive fields and projects now naturally using karate has was a good idea for that.
02:57:40 [W1] So they run a kubernative cluster.
02:57:42 [W1] It's mostly located in California, but also other parts of the country and they have some nodes and Pacific Asian region in Europe.
02:57:48 [W1] All of this is connected through a with a fast ten hundred Deer research Network.
02:57:56 [W1] Now this cluster incorporates Force F clusters managed by Rook to petabyte-scale in the u.s.
02:58:02 [W1] Western region five hundred terabytes in u.s.
02:58:05 [W1] Eastern Region 8 terabytes video wall SSD only local a hundred 30 terabytes nvme only local and soon to be added in asia-pacific fool.
02:58:18 [W1] now the following is a direct quote from PRP about how Rook has enabled them to be successful Rook is tremendously helping us to deploy a reliably a reliable fast or too scientific users Rook makes administration of a large
02:58:46 [W1] Relations easier and remove multi multiple tasks of nodes management from personnel which helps reduce costs and increase efficiency data storage is a key component of scientific Computing computations and Rook does a perfectly for us. Thank you.
02:59:01 [W1] P and thank you Rick for sharing.
02:59:05 [W1] I'm to the last project we're going to talk about today is the test.
02:59:09 [W1] The test is a database solution for deploying scaling and managing large clusters of Open Source database instances It Sports MySQL and mariadb it is architected to run as effectively on public or private Cloud architecture as it
02:59:24 [W1] Dedicated hardware and it combines and extends many important SQL features of the scalability of nosql database.
02:59:31 [W1] And so some of the things problems, you know that I tries to solve our scaling SQL database by sharding it migrating from bare metal to private private or public Cloud not reliably as one word was trying to say and
02:59:47 [W1] pulling in managing a large number of scale SQL database instances
02:59:53 [W1] One fun fact that I know about before is of a Tesla was actually running on kubernative.
02:59:59 [W1] Zat YouTube before kubernative 1.0 around for a while. That's awesome.
03:00:05 [W1] In terms of some updates there been four major releases this year and the latest release 8.0 is compatible with over 10 modern SQL Frameworks, including WordPress and Ruby on Rails active record.
03:00:19 [W1] And for last 10 years our story slack, so the beginning of 2017 slack began adoption of a test.
03:00:29 [W1] by in August of 2017.
03:00:33 [W1] It started serving production traffic.
03:00:37 [W1] After completing a re-architecture and migration of slacks core product features by early 2020 roughly Center Center traffic was passing through the tests, and they had designed a framework to migrate one table at a time. Now, you're probably wondering what about
03:00:52 [W1] Reading 30% and that is the Crux of the problem.
03:00:56 [W1] They had done a calculation that it would take three to five years at least for engineers to migrate the remaining 30% of the Legacy system.
03:01:05 [W1] And that's a really long time. Now, they knew it was going to take a while and so in 2019, they spend effort investigating alternative strategy or alternative strategies to do the migration and what they found was if
03:01:20 [W1] Leveraging of your application functionality that they can migrate entire clusters to the test.
03:01:26 [W1] Now this resulted in as of now the 99% of traffic at slac uses the test and that the migration will be complete by end of year.
03:01:39 [W1] And just to share direct quote we moved hundreds of terabytes of data over a thousand MySQL shards zero downtime not a single outage equally important.
03:01:50 [W1] It was transparent her applications. Thank you so much for sharing and thank you for tests.
03:01:56 [W1] Now before we cut off for a moment, I want to call us another graduations take Abby.
03:02:05 [W1] TUF the update framework
03:02:09 [W1] Harbor
03:02:11 [W1] And Helm, these are other projects that have graduated since we all met together in San Diego last year.
03:02:17 [W1] Please give them a virtual Round of Applause.
03:02:18 [W1] Use those slack emojis, please congratulations to the community contributors maintainers a lot of hard work and it's well earned.
03:02:29 [W1] At our last Mets last message of the day.
03:02:31 [W1] Please go to cncf dot IO / projects to get a full list of all the different projects that are supported and also use leverage maintainer track session the meet the maintainers.
03:02:42 [W1] Sure, you probably have a lot of questions.
03:02:44 [W1] And so please use this time to reach out to find out what's going on with the project and asked, you know get answers to your questions.
03:02:51 [W1] Thank you very much everyone and have good coupon by.
03:03:01 [W1] Thank you so much constants for those project updates.
03:03:04 [W1] So exciting to see all the activity happening across the landscape next up. We have dr.
03:03:11 [W1] Shin Jang. He is a VP of volcano engine at bite dance and we'll be talking about volcano engines Cloud native Journey, please welcome. Dr. Zhang.
03:03:40 [W1] I'm a VP of volcano engine are by dance.
03:03:44 [W1] I feel very honored to be here to present to you about what we do why and how we approach it?
03:03:51 [W1] by August 20 2013 the most popular short video content platform in China has reached 600 million da you or daily active user and the Mau or monthly active user of all Biden's apps
03:04:07 [W1] Has reached 1.5 billion globally we're talking about the Rockies big growth here.
03:04:13 [W1] Given the huge amount of Diversified content and information are platforms carry and for though in this video content aggregation editing analysis and a recommendation.
03:04:24 [W1] are highly relevant with real-time distributed storage Computing capacity and orchestration.
03:04:33 [W1] It has never been an easy task to manage them all at a such scalability.
03:04:40 [W1] Over time we have generated a coherent framework that works from the infrastructure operating system level to meet platform then end-to-end sweets for growth that can also be paired with various industrialized
03:04:55 [W1] Illusions such capabilities and the methodology have been quickly serving the needs of various business lines or units in by dance over the past eight years, as you know Hotel doughy were the early ones and
03:05:10 [W1] And data mobile Etc.
03:05:12 [W1] Now all these come in combo in volcano engine.
03:05:17 [W1] We call this coherent framework one set and with these sweets and capabilities.
03:05:23 [W1] Volcano engine has boosted by dense growth in the past in the similar manner were thinking we can help other companies or Enterprises to grow by using the same set of core Technologies and the best practices.
03:05:38 [W1] That's the essence and the mission of volcano engine as mentioned during the years.
03:05:44 [W1] We have built all these phenomenal apps like though in we have been faced with the growth of millions of users and content.
03:05:52 [W1] need cloudevents.
03:06:07 [W1] And on lots of times we need to go against the traditional go to habits of building apps from static and monolithic to achieve scalability in a cloud knative way from our experience
03:06:22 [W1] Clown native in production.
03:06:24 [W1] It's not only about shifting a single app or as data set up to the cloud or automating certain tasks or integration.
03:06:31 [W1] It's about seriously having the whole business to the cloud native level a complete transformation that involves technical procedural and sometimes even organizational challenges.
03:06:44 [W1] While Ken anjan has been going the clown 84 way since very early on build on the half million notes scale.
03:06:51 [W1] We're dealing with we gain experience and had valuable and vital lessons, which could be also useful to companies and developers in the community who are going through the same Cloud native transformation and confusion
03:07:06 [W1] We're interested to share and exchange this information and insight with the community friends. And at the same time, we'd love to continue to contribute to the open source projects including kubernative kubeflow.
03:07:19 [W1] Not only the cloud native oxygen projects, but also those relevant with data-driven goals
03:07:28 [W1] and the debut on the cube can't stake today is a very important milestone for volcano engine to present its cloudevents Tory. We hope to connect with every one of you in the community to inspire creativity and in reach our
03:07:43 [W1] knative life
03:07:49 [W1] Thank you.
03:07:49 [W1] Thank you.
03:07:49 [W1] Thank you.
03:07:49 [W1] Thank you.
03:07:50 [W1] Thank you. Dr. Shin Jang.
03:07:51 [W1] Don't forget do round of applauses in the Keynotes Channel or the hallway.
03:07:55 [W1] Just leave the event help desk for any questions.
03:07:58 [W1] But thank you. Once again, dr.
03:08:00 [W1] Shin Jang.
03:08:00 [W1] Our next presenter is Brianna Frank.
03:08:03 [W1] Brianna is the director of product at IBM cloud and today she'll discuss how communities everywhere can ultimately power 5 G tellers blanking and distribute analytics, please welcome, Brianna Frank.
03:08:40 [W1] Hi, I'm Brianna Frank.
03:08:41 [W1] I am the director of product at IBM cloud and I'm so excited to be here at coupon 2020.
03:08:48 [W1] So today I'm going to talk about this concept of kubernative.
03:08:51 [W1] He's but needed everywhere and I'm going to walk you through a few real world examples that I'm seeing across a couple different Industries where kubernative he's is needed, but it's needed in lots of different locations.
03:09:04 [W1] So the first example is in the financial industry and on the surface the financial industry might seem like it's all about money, but it's really all about technology in order to compete financial institutions need to create exceptional user experiences.
03:09:20 [W1] And they leverage Ai and trading algorithms to help stay ahead of the market, but it is also a very heavily regulated industry and so Financial Services clients need to iterate quickly leveraging Cloud native tools and best practices.
03:09:35 [W1] Is but they need to be able to keep that data secure and compliant in sometimes that means they might have there might be some restrictions on where that data can live.
03:09:48 [W1] So here's a scenario that's emerging to solve that problem distributed cloud or kubernative as a service anywhere and you know Gartner refers to it as distributed Cloud IDC calls it local Cloud as a service, but this is a
03:10:03 [W1] And to have where the public cloud is now extended to lots of different locations different public Cloud examples on-prem examples or even at the edge and so the key Point here is that distributed Cloud enables you to take advantage
03:10:18 [W1] Of a public Cloud consumption model but in many different locations and you don't have to be an expert in running these software Stacks to run them outside of the public cloud.
03:10:29 [W1] So let's take a look at an example of this concept of kubernative everywhere in action.
03:10:36 [W1] And so, you know in this example, one of our clients is really focused on worker safety.
03:10:42 [W1] And so they're leveraging distributed analytics to keep workers safe.
03:10:47 [W1] So in this scenario, you know, you might have a business or an office building that is actually under construction and you need to be able to leverage video analytics to tell if someone is wearing a hard hat or not and workloads.
03:10:59 [W1] In them before they move into a potentially dangerous area that building. So in this scenario you want to use video analytics, but you really can't have any latency because if you warn someone too late, they could possibly be injured or hurt.
03:11:15 [W1] So let's take a look at how this scenario might works.
03:11:20 [W1] So if you think about solving a safety problem, you need to be able to analyze video data from many cameras all over the office building and it's impractical to send all of that data back to the cloud to be processed remotely.
03:11:32 [W1] So for this scenario to work, well it would be better the video processing were to happen closer to the device.
03:11:39 [W1] So traditionally to do that. It would require you to install servers and software and manage them on.
03:11:45 [W1] Prem with kubernetes and distributed Cloud we can extend the public Cloud into the office so we can leverage cloud services to run this application close to the the device and that's critical so we can reduce latency and we can effectively warn someone.
03:12:00 [W1] Fine if they enter a dangerous area, so now what's interesting is that same workers scenario and client is having to evolve and you know because of covid there are new demands and new challenges that we have to adapt to
03:12:15 [W1] And so now that same client instead of having to warn someone about a hard hat.
03:12:21 [W1] We're really worried about making sure folks are wearing masks and making sure folks are wearing masks correctly and that the mask hasn't slipped Down Under the nose.
03:12:28 [W1] We're also leveraging thermal devices to take someone's temperature before they enter a congested area and we're also using video analytics to see how much usage is happening in a specific room and an office building
03:12:43 [W1] Or even a hospital so we can determine if that room needs to be sanitized.
03:12:48 [W1] So this is an example where you know, we had a really interesting, you know worker safety use case, but we're having to iterate quickly due to real world demands and some of these demands were hard to predict and so we have to be able to react quickly
03:13:03 [W1] And using this Cloud native best practices, but applying them to the edge.
03:13:08 [W1] Thank you so much for listening. If you'd like to learn more about kubernative everywhere go to IBM dot Biz flash coupon 2020.
03:13:17 [W1] Thank you so much and enjoy the rest of coupon.
03:13:31 [W1] Thank you, Brianna.
03:13:32 [W1] Keep the round of applause coming in the keynote annulled and next speaker.
03:13:37 [W1] He will definitely not be mr.
03:13:39 [W1] To our next presenter is Steven Augustus.
03:13:43 [W1] He is a senior open source engine RPM where he is also my co-chair and today he'll be giving some updates on kubernative, please welcome Steven Augustus.
03:14:02 [W1] Hello.
03:14:02 [W1] Hello everyone.
03:14:03 [W1] My name is Steven Augustus. And I am one of your co-chairs for Kube con Cloud knative Khan and a virtual.
03:14:09 [W1] I'm here to talk to you about the kubernative project and we're going to do some project updates. So let's jump into it.
03:14:19 [W1] Now the kubernative project is comprised of people and we believe in and we care deeply for the people that work on this project day to day.
03:14:29 [W1] It would be impossible to talk about what we did for the year without talking about the 2020 of it all now our response initially to to covid to dealing with
03:14:45 [W1] Kind of Shifting for a lot of people Shifting the way they worked Shifting the way they interacted with people and moving towards more virtual content moving towards
03:15:00 [W1] Less meetings when possible being more accommodating about time zones about families. So hat tip to everyone in the project that that really is involved. Sub-project owners Sig chairs and Technical leads committee members, who
03:15:16 [W1] we're incredibly present in conscious about how people are kind of coping with everything that's going on in the world and to that you may be familiar with the kubernative A's
03:15:31 [W1] IO website and we put up a we put up a banner on the website too clearly disclaim that racism is unacceptable race, and it's not something that we
03:15:46 [W1] Tolerate in the project We Believe deeply in our code of conduct and enforcing it to protect the members of of this project.
03:15:55 [W1] So again, hat tip to all of the folks that actually worked on applying the ability to give our website banners steering committee for working with me on the messaging and and
03:16:10 [W1] Delivering that and and holding holding the line.
03:16:13 [W1] I think that you know, it's very it's very easy for statements that can be deemed to be political to attract trolls and we had our fair share of that.
03:16:26 [W1] again hat tip to to everyone involved code of conduct committee steering committee contributor experience for taking on that burden for for feeling.
03:16:39 [W1] Feeling it necessary and important to speak about something.
03:16:44 [W1] that's not a political issue something that is human issue.
03:16:46 [W1] So the chairs and Technical leads we recently spun up.
03:16:53 [W1] It's not recently anymore.
03:16:55 [W1] It's been it's been quite some time now spun up a chair and Technical lead meetings. So giving an opportunity for all of our leadership across the project to sit down chat in in a
03:17:09 [W1] A safe space to exchange ideas without any, you know kind of the the the blameless retrospectives and the and you know having having that safe space to to
03:17:25 [W1] Create ideas that you may not feel comfortable sharing publicly.
03:17:30 [W1] Now. We also started the annual report process.
03:17:34 [W1] So the steering committee kick that off the annual reports essentially starting with the working groups having annual check ins for each of these governance groups giving us an opportunity to get a better feedback loop.
03:17:49 [W1] Between the the the groups that exist in our community and The Wider Community.
03:17:55 [W1] It's very easy to kind of operate in a vacuum. If you are if you don't have you know the chance to to speak about all the accomplishments that you've been doing and also and spread that out
03:18:10 [W1] To the community. So so great great work. They're all of the all the moderators again going back into just handling.
03:18:23 [W1] Handling all of the various of the various properties that we own across Twitter across the the website across discuss.
03:18:32 [W1] hat tip to everyone YouTube Zoom for making everything that we do safe to do and and welcoming.
03:18:45 [W1] Now speaking of Twitter that at the Kate's contributors Twitter handle, which is handled by by contributor experience and the the marketing sub-project of contribute experience.
03:18:59 [W1] So very awesome to see us being able to publish updates about the community more frequently to wider The Wider internet now the the triage kept which poddisruptionbudgets
03:19:14 [W1] Top now we have, you know made a lot of improvements in how we kind of decrease the burden for you to maintain your areas. Right? And I think
03:19:30 [W1] Part of it is was introducing this triage kept something that we discussed for quite some time to get some of the finer details worked out and apply the automation to to the process.
03:19:41 [W1] So hat tip to everyone that was involved there across contributor experience as well as as well as the the enhancements sub-teams and sub-project of sagarika texture.
03:19:56 [W1] The Ingress the Ingress enhancement went g a super exciting long-standing enhancement that has been has been in beta and and it is one of
03:20:11 [W1] Earlier enhancements so great to see the work around delivering that to General availability from the GitHub management side the GitHub Administration Management
03:20:26 [W1] Team has been hard at work deprecating the the kubernetes incubator org, all of the projects that are involved in that org. Some of them that may have been made no longer be maintained
03:20:41 [W1] We built something bigger and better and it lives somewhere else now, so kind of wrangling all of that information and kind of bringing us to the the sunset of the the incubator org.
03:20:55 [W1] now
03:20:57 [W1] first some Sig specific updates we have Sig usability.
03:21:02 [W1] So usability has been driving a user research study that has been that has gotten some really great data to Crunch on and that will be part of their Sig updates during the conference.
03:21:17 [W1] So hat tip to them for one forming over the last year as well as all of the work that they've done to better understand the people who consume kubernative.
03:21:27 [W1] He stated a from Sig multi cluster. The multi cluster service apis are in progress.
03:21:36 [W1] They're currently Alpha. They represent Some solid progress towards normalizing multi cluster deployments and making the next level of kubernative operations more manageable.
03:21:46 [W1] And that's definitely you know, that's definitely something that we consider with, you know, having all of these disparity environments. So how to say
03:21:57 [W1] Multi cluster from the storage side. The container object storage interface was released for both block and file Kate storage being able to build a similar interface for
03:22:12 [W1] for object storage is also coming PSC is
03:23:19 [W1] In down for that so we should see that soon generic ephemeral volumes. We're progressed across the last few Cycles CSI support for Windows, which is huge huge step forward for
03:23:34 [W1] Windows support on kubernative overall the volume snapshot feature is also progressed.
03:23:41 [W1] And yeah, so, you know moving into moving into Sig docks Sig Doc's did an awesome job on the website migration more modern theme easier to
03:23:56 [W1] 18 for their contributors and on the architecture side the production Readiness sub-project as well as the pr R reviews as part of kept our now making their way into the release cycle from the Sig
03:24:11 [W1] Side we've been working on tooling to make our lives easier to make your lives easier to make it easier to release kubernative overall to make it safer.
03:24:21 [W1] It's released kubernative.
03:24:22 [W1] So well as the working group Kate's infra who's been hard at work one.
03:24:27 [W1] You'll hear more about the G the Kate stop cri-o cut over from Google infrastructure to community infrastructure during the conference.
03:24:35 [W1] You'll hear more about the image promotion process how we're handling artifacts moving forward as we now
03:24:41 [W1] now own those artifacts and Community infrastructure.
03:24:45 [W1] And then finally the working group naming was formed right this this kind of ties back into the thought of making sure that this project is is inclusive and being being
03:25:00 [W1] Awful about the language that we use across both our code bases and our an R & R content overall.
03:25:09 [W1] So stay tuned for more details on that later in the conference and a as well as a community meeting from a new initiative that's happening on kind of The Wider Community across LF cncf
03:25:24 [W1] I have standards bodies different companies. So stay tuned for that. Thanks everyone later.
03:25:42 [W1] Thank you Stephen for sharing.
03:25:43 [W1] It is only part of it.
03:25:48 [W1] So thank you to all of our keynote speakers for kicking off the first set of key notes.

03:26:04 [W1] Don't forget to take care of yourself. We understand that the event can be overwhelming and have
03:26:09 [W1] They keep Cloud native. Well initiative virtually this includes chair stretching chair yoga meditation and even puppy and kitten cams. So get out your get out your little family.
03:26:23 [W1] Yes information for all of this can be found in the platform within the experiences suction and Constance. You want to talk more about experiences.
03:26:34 [W1] Yeah. So some of the experiences you can find information about virtual trivia and Escape rooms.
03:26:39 [W1] Virtual escape room sounds like a lot of fun. So you do need to sign up for these so definitely go to that part.
03:26:47 [W1] so next to the experience is tab, you'll see game on which is which it has all the information you need to participate in the virtual games to earn Badges and various prizes also and so after each session attend
03:27:02 [W1] I won't read it ha.
03:27:04 [W1] Oh, sorry.

03:28:14 [W1] Have fun.
03:28:22 [W1] Our job is to make kubernative easier and easier and easier to use either from an Ops point of view or developer point of view while acknowledging it is complex because we're solving a complex problem.
03:29:32 [W1] Kubernative will be boring as soon as we can make it boring.
03:29:35 [W1] Maybe after I retire it's already boring.
03:29:39 [W1] So I think we're well on our journey towards kubernative being boring.
03:29:43 [W1] It'll only be boring when it's done.
03:29:45 [W1] It'll only be done when it's no longer relevant.

01:31:26 [W1] Before we start our programming today.
01:31:29 [W1] I would like to play this message from Jim's emlyn the executive director of the Linux Foundation about cncf longtime leader Dan Khan who recently passed away due to complications from colon cancer.
01:31:49 [W1] You know 2020 has been a very tough year and you know Dan was as all of you know from this community Forever The Optimist and Problem Solver when he was diagnosed.
01:32:03 [W1] He sought to defy the odds and fight this disease as long as he could sadly and very suddenly things took a turn for the worse and Dan did succumb to his illness in a short time.
01:32:16 [W1] You know Dan played a special role at the foundation his impact far exceeded his time with us.
01:32:23 [W1] He helped establish the organization we are today and he oversaw the fastest-growing open source community in history your community the cloud native Computing Foundation.
01:32:37 [W1] Dan was also a Pioneer in 1994.
01:32:41 [W1] Something all of us use almost every day.
01:32:45 [W1] Dan was opinionated.
01:32:46 [W1] He never strayed from a debate via email or in person, you know, I love to go to dinners with Dan because I knew the conversation would always be interesting and I wouldn't have to say a word.
01:33:01 [W1] Does that sound familiar to anybody you know in the open source community?
01:33:06 [W1] Indeed it does because Dan was one of you and we're lucky to spend time with him.
01:33:15 [W1] What you may not know about Dan was his lifelong desire to help others.
01:33:21 [W1] From serving as a volunteer firefighter in college to his constant advocacy to encourage diversity in the cncf community and an open source in general to stepping aside from his role in
01:33:36 [W1] Foundation to incubate and found the Linux Foundation Public Health Initiative, which is helping Public Health authorities around the world combat covid-19.
01:33:34 [W1] Dan could always be counted on to help in a crisis.
01:33:39 [W1] Initial reactions to his death from members of our community and many of you are full of statements Dan help me paired with a life or career changing impact many of us
01:33:55 [W1] Members of our community and many of you are full of statements Dan help me paired with a life or career changing impact many of us benefited directly from Dan's generosity of time
01:34:07 [W1] from Dan's generosity of time and thoughtfulness
01:34:13 [W1] Dan leaves behind his wife Julie and two young boys Adam and Ellis whom he loved dearly and many of you probably met at one of the many cncf events around the world.
01:34:28 [W1] This even more tragic is that Dan himself lost both his parents at roughly the same age as his boys are today to the AIDS pandemic.
01:34:38 [W1] This is why our Public Health effort was so important to him personally.
01:34:46 [W1] I was able to spend some time with Dan the week he passed and he wanted me to tell all of you how much he loved working with everyone in the open source community.
01:35:00 [W1] He was truly proud to have had the opportunity to help impact so many lives through his work and friendships in your world.
01:35:12 [W1] You know.
01:35:14 [W1] Today, it seems like the world is sick from so many things.
01:35:21 [W1] And while Dan didn't succeed in defeating his illness it was his wish that we carry on in the spirit of collaboration and generosity in establishing the Linux Foundation
01:35:36 [W1] As a shared resource not just to fight the covid-19 pandemic but to combat Future Health crisis.
01:35:45 [W1] In the end Dan wanted us all to see beyond each other's weaknesses and to work together in the spirit of love and kindness.
01:35:58 [W1] And we will honor his legacy by doing just that.
01:36:03 [W1] Not only in public health, but in all the important work all of you do together in open source.
01:36:13 [W1] We would like to support his family in this time of loss and secure a future for his boys college education.
01:36:21 [W1] For those of you who can contribute we've set up a site that you can contribute to the Dan con family education trust through the URL.
01:36:33 [W1] You see on your screen right now.
01:36:37 [W1] If you'd never rather not donate through that option A Family Trust is being set up that you would be able to contribute to directly and you can email the Linux Foundation to find out how to contribute there as well.
01:36:52 [W1] We encourage everybody to consider thanking Dan for his contributions by supporting his family.
01:37:01 [W1] I want to thank all of you so much.
01:37:03 [W1] this Stan
01:36:56 [W1] and on his behalf.
01:36:57 [W1] I want to express how much he cared for each and every one of you.
01:37:05 [W1] Thank you.
01:37:06 [W1] Good morning, Barcelona.
01:37:17 [W1] My name is Dan Khan and I am executive director of the cloud native Computing Foundation.
01:38:20 [W1] In the work that we're doing here together this week building on top of the shoulders of giants. Maybe neither Swift nor easy, but is also laying the foundations of the next generation of Innovations, which are even now being
01:38:35 [W1] half of kubernative
01:38:43 [W1] Thank you very much.
01:38:56 [W1] What an amazing tribute for an amazing man?
01:39:16 [W1] Hello, everyone. Welcome to coupon Cloud native con North America.
01:39:22 [W1] I'm Priyanka Sharma and I'm the general manager of the cloud native Computing Foundation.
01:39:28 [W1] It is my great pleasure to welcome you here Dan built this amazing ecosystem with all of us.
01:39:37 [W1] where the story of Team Cloud native a story of diversity powered resilience
01:39:43 [W1] And it is this diversity that makes us more resilient to weather any challenge.
01:39:46 [W1] Even the loss of a great leader.
01:39:50 [W1] As Dan grew this community diversity was at the Cornerstone of everything he built he changed the face of what tech conferences look like with inspirational coupon chairs and attendees from all kinds of backgrounds.
01:40:03 [W1] Just like all of you under his leadership and users became an official part of our ecosystem and we became a global movement.
01:40:15 [W1] Dance contribution to our world are many and to borrow from a well-known quote.
01:40:20 [W1] Dan was the man in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs who comes short again and again because there is no effort without error
01:40:35 [W1] Coming but who does actually strive to do the Deeds who knows great enthusiasms the great devotions who spends himself in a worthy cause who at best knows in the end the Triumph
01:40:49 [W1] Achievement and who at worst if he fails at least fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid Souls who neither know Victory nor defeat.
01:40:56 [W1] That is the standard dance at for us and we will not let him down.
01:41:01 [W1] team Cloud native I say we are the ones in the arena we will fight on and keep building the technology the community and the stories that Dan laid the foundation for
01:41:14 [W1] 2020 has thrown a lot at us.
01:41:17 [W1] But these are the kind of challenges that open source and Cloud native were built for our resilience comes from are far-reaching diverse Community. Dan worked tirelessly to diversify not only our
01:41:32 [W1] the den lead the foundation for
01:41:34 [W1] 2020 has thrown a lot at us.
01:41:36 [W1] But these are the kind of challenges that open source and Cloud native were built for our resilience comes from are far-reaching diverse Community. Dan worked tirelessly to diversify not only our
01:42:08 [W1] But also our Geographic reach and the end users we so who in turn Dutch hundreds of millions of consumers with their products and services.
01:42:19 [W1] It is my commitment to you that we will double down on those efforts those efforts to innovate more faster better by unleashing and enabling the power of a diverse Foundation of doors.
01:42:34 [W1] In order to do so we need to hold ourselves to the highest standards of inclusion.
01:42:41 [W1] Unfortunately, our ethos is not always reflected in our code.
01:42:47 [W1] To date offensive terminology such as Master Slave and whitelist Blacklist exists in our code bases the kubernative community recognized this and has already made big changes.
01:43:02 [W1] Building upon their work in the kubernative naming working group and partnering with industry France such as IBM and red hat and many others. We have kicked off across organizational corroboration focused on inclusive naming in
01:43:17 [W1] The goal of the initiative is to help motivated projects and organizations to effectively change manage to better terminology.
01:43:28 [W1] When it comes to diversity and inclusion open source has broken the barriers we call borders.
01:43:35 [W1] The cloud native Community is no exception Dan after all right Cube, gone2asia pack and under his leadership cncf welcomed both members and projects from the region.
01:43:47 [W1] Today, I am thrilled to welcome volcano engine by byte dance a global company based in China to cncf as a platinum member.
01:43:57 [W1] Let's learn more about them from their VP doctors.
01:44:02 [W1] Jinjiang joining us from Beijing. Machina engine is an Enterprise class service platform lunch by the Chinese technology company by dance. We have more than
01:44:17 [W1] than employees across a hundred and fifty countries are apps including the total content platform and the dough in video sharing social network support 75 different languages and our amount the most popular in
01:44:32 [W1] - of countries we have been a very heavy user of clown 80s knowledge is for a long time violence for example uses containers to manage half a million physical machines across tens of data centers.
01:44:34 [W1] All of our apps have been built on top of microservices and servicemeshcon deeply know the value of cloudevents acknowledge. He's in a secondly part of vicuna engine strategy is to place a lot of emphasis
01:44:49 [W1] Developer echo system and a community. We want to open source our own Technologies around things like clown ATIV storage and a cloud native machine learning.
01:44:48 [W1] We want to impact the developer community and a cncf is one of the top communities in this domain.
01:44:56 [W1] So that's the right channel to draw.
01:44:59 [W1] I definitely agree with that. Thank you for joining us June.
01:45:06 [W1] Asia is not the only place in brazing Cloud native.
01:45:10 [W1] The Passion of our community connects dots across many parts of the globe take for instance Kasten a start-up in the San Francisco Bay area that was recently acquired by VM and international company in the data protection
01:45:25 [W1] So that's the right channel to draw.
01:45:20 [W1] I definitely agree with that. Thank you for joining us June.
01:45:27 [W1] Asia is not the only place embracing Cloud native.
01:45:31 [W1] The Passion of our community connects dots across many parts of the globe take for instance Kasten a start-up in the San Francisco Bay area that was recently acquired by VM and international company in the data production space.
01:46:31 [W1] The US and Switzerland today, they are upgrading to a platinum membership their general manager nearish. Talia has joined me here today.
01:46:41 [W1] Let's learn from him about why Kasten by VM is doubling down on cncf of you who don't already know us Gaston is the market leader for kubernative data management.
01:46:53 [W1] We make it very easy for more developers and operators to run stateful qualitative applications by providing a powerful kubernative knative.
01:47:01 [W1] The platform for backup disaster recovery and cross cluster and cross Cloud application were billeted. The recently. We were a startup that in fact emerge from stuff that who conned in 2017 given what we owe to this community increasing our support for cncf.
01:47:16 [W1] After a recent acquisition by me as an extremely important with easy decision to make and also shows the commitment to the broader ecosystem looking forward as exciting as things are today.
01:47:27 [W1] I believe that we still have a great in front of us.
01:47:30 [W1] I remember my first group called Seattle in 2016.
01:47:33 [W1] And even though cloudevents Knology adoption is taken of that. He sticks instead.
01:47:38 [W1] We will look back at the news very fond memories of what will still feel like the early days.
01:47:44 [W1] Given how important developers and big application Centric is to everything that we do at Kasten.
01:47:50 [W1] I'm also looking forward to seeing the team for engage even further with both the community and cncf during this period of upcoming growth to everyone out there. Thank you so much for having us.
01:48:02 [W1] Thank you for your support neeraj.
01:48:05 [W1] As gin and neeraja have shared these new memberships are in a march to our community our technology and its promise for end-users.
01:48:15 [W1] This ecosystem is so Diversified after all we built the ship on kubernative and its success enabled knative manded a constellation of projects to support modernizing applications.
01:48:31 [W1] This ecosystem is so Diversified after all we built the ship on kubernative and its success enabled knative manded a constellation of projects to support modernizing applications.
01:48:46 [W1] Today many of our 70 plus projects are used in tandem by our end users to meet their diverse Cloud native needs for example cncf host the vitess project, which is a database clustering system for
01:49:10 [W1] my SQL
01:49:12 [W1] and use a company HubSpot uses vitess to run a hundred percent off their my SQL clusters on top of kubernative processing a hundred plus terabytes of data.
01:49:26 [W1] Another end-user company pay it provides a digital platform for government agencies think digital DMV after adopting kubernative Prometheus Envoy and fluent e paid reduce their infrastructure
01:49:41 [W1] and percent of Revenue
01:49:43 [W1] that is cloud native at its finest as you can see our end users are changing the world.
01:49:51 [W1] And many of you are sitting in the audience in your own homes today.
01:49:56 [W1] That's why and user-driven open source is so inspiring today workloads are run at a scale never seen before managing complexity.
01:50:07 [W1] None of us has ever experienced establishing a direct feedback loop between our end users and projects has been invaluable and further diversifies team Cloud native. We thank you and users for taking the
01:50:21 [W1] Time and effort and we promise to continue to build and user-driven open source here in Cloud native with you.
01:50:29 [W1] And as you have told us security concerns rise to the top of the metaphorical stack as you bring Cloud native Pilots to production fear not team Cloud native is here to support earlier this year.
01:50:43 [W1] We announced a new certification certified kubernative security specialist or cks.
01:50:49 [W1] The cks is a performance-based exam today.
01:50:53 [W1] I'm excited to announce that registration for cks is officially open. If you're an end-user company, this certification will help you train and certify your developers for the working knowledge of container security.
01:51:07 [W1] Ready concerns rise to the top of the metaphorical stack as you bring Cloud native Pilots to production fear. Not team Cloud native is here to support earlier this year.
01:51:14 [W1] We announced a new certification certified kubernative security specialist or cks. The cks is a performance-based exam today.
01:51:24 [W1] I'm excited to announce that registration for cks is officially open.

01:51:39 [W1] I encourage you to invest in your developers and support their Journey from devops to Dub Sack ups with the cks resilience comes in many forms diversifying skill sets is one of them.
01:51:54 [W1] Finally, let's talk about a diversity not often discussed that of workloads different verticals have unique requirements and as the cloud native ecosystem has matured it is now positioned to address these needs.
01:52:09 [W1] Two of the most demanding verticals that are also critical to our lives are Telco. S' and Edge Computing the cloud native ecosystem has kicked off a cloud native Network function working group to Define Telco workloads
01:52:24 [W1] Different verticals have unique requirements and as the cloud native ecosystem has matured it is now positioned to address these needs.
01:52:33 [W1] Two of the most demanding verticals that are also critical to our lives our Telco s' and Edge computing.
01:52:41 [W1] The cloud native ecosystem has kicked off Cloud native Network function working group to Define Telco workloads based on kubernative.
01:52:51 [W1] If this is something you care about please attend our CNF working group kickoff on Thursday to learn more and participate.
01:53:00 [W1] On The Edge front I'm excited to announce that Cox Communications shares our vision of bringing Cloud native to the edge and is joining the cncf as a gold member Cox is the largest private Broadband company
01:53:15 [W1] Serving homes and businesses with critical connectivity and solutions.
01:53:21 [W1] Cox is investing in educator abilities and looks forward to partnering with developers across the ecosystem in delivering cloud services and low latency performance to their residential and business customers.
01:53:34 [W1] We are thrilled to have them on board as a member and look forward to working with them in the coming year.
01:53:42 [W1] When I think about all of this great work, I've been with pride pride at all of our efforts Pride at the resilience. We have shown in this challenging year.
01:53:55 [W1] In all of the tributes, I read about Dan everyone shared how kind and caring he was and I experienced the same with him.
01:54:05 [W1] He was a Visionary with a gentle soul.
01:54:07 [W1] Someone who always wanted to see how he could help improve the lives of others.
01:54:14 [W1] Let's live our lives by his example.
01:54:18 [W1] Let's find the time to say hello to someone who may be churning out PRS and could use a break.
01:54:25 [W1] Let's reach out to someone who may have gone dark and see if they need a helping hand.
01:54:30 [W1] How kind and caring he was and I experienced the same with him.
01:54:30 [W1] He was a Visionary with a gentle soul.
01:54:32 [W1] Someone who always wanted to see how he could help improve the lives of others.
01:54:39 [W1] Let's live our lives by his example.
01:54:43 [W1] Let's find the time to say hello to someone who may be churning out PRS and could use a break.
01:54:50 [W1] Let's reach out to someone who may have gone dark and see if they need a helping hand.
01:54:56 [W1] I don't want anyone to ever doubt even for a minute that there is a place for them here in team Cloud near the answer is always yes, because diversity powered resilience is what
01:55:42 [W1] Is what open source and Cloud native are all about the webinar live us inclusive connected and stronger because of it.
01:55:52 [W1] Resilience is built not born our open source way of doing.
01:56:15 [W1] Will build ever more resilience in our companies in our organizations in our society. We are on the brink of change across borders and certainly in the United States.
01:56:28 [W1] Our diversity our openness. Our differences will power.
01:56:37 [W1] Untold Innovation Innovation that matters Innovation that makes end-users more efficient productive and creative and Innovation that ultimately adds value to the life of every single human being
01:56:54 [W1] Team Cloud native dancer has on the staff and now it's on us.
01:56:59 [W1] I say to you today make the most of Kube con Cloud knative coins, and this amazing community that is gathered here. Go engage with each other learn from the sessions be inspired and go do great things.
01:57:13 [W1] Innovation that matters Innovation that makes end users more efficient productive and creative and Innovation that ultimately adds value to the life of every single human being team
01:58:26 [W1] Hey, so my last conversation with Dan was actually around joining as a cube conch are and whether or not I'd be up for it.
01:58:37 [W1] And I think that you know overall just thinking about all of the things that have been said about Dan about the community about what he has started and what we continue to carry forward is huge.
01:58:52 [W1] The the impact that was made and the opportunities that have been given to so many people in the cloud native space to do great work and to get together and deliver and just be a cloud native family.
01:59:06 [W1] think is what is what Rings true out of out of everything, you know for me. I'm going to going to the memorial and just hearing everything the Dan has been a part of makes me think about like how we can
01:59:22 [W1] How we can think bigger right?
01:59:24 [W1] I feel like I'm just getting started in terms of like thinking big and learning how to lead.
01:59:30 [W1] So so I think that's what I take away from his his legacy trying to be better trying to deliver you a great conference trying to to do to do better for everyone.
01:59:42 [W1] So, thank you Steven.
01:59:49 [W1] Yeah, I think.
01:59:52 [W1] If you know me, I'm not really good on my feet.
01:59:54 [W1] And so I'll be definitely paraphrasing a lot of people said but
02:00:01 [W1] alright this pretty much sort of say like thank you Dan for getting us here and like for planting the seeds for where we can locally won't go and that
02:00:16 [W1] You Steven?
02:00:15 [W1] Yeah, I think.
02:00:18 [W1] If you know me, I'm not really good on my feet.
02:00:20 [W1] And so I'll be definitely paraphrasing a lot of people said but
02:00:27 [W1] right this pretty much sort of say like thank you Dan for getting us here and like for planting the seeds for where we can locally will go and
02:00:40 [W1] that
02:00:42 [W1] you know, it's like it's our homework and you know should be your takeaway is that we should all try to emulate, you know, his kindness his compassion and you know his energy and values to continue to make this community, you know to continue to
02:01:00 [W1] it's our homework and you know should be your takeaways that we should all try to emulate, you know, his kindness is compassion and you know his energy and values to continue to make this community, you know to continue to grow this community because
02:01:15 [W1] Testament to over the past few years I Austin was my first conference and I think I was like two 4,000 people and if this were to be in person who had been meant for what we're estimating almost 15,000 people read That's and that's just in person, right?
02:01:30 [W1] Showing how much is community is grown is direct, you know is from Dan's hard work and so we should all continue to emulate his energy and values and thank you Dan for everything you've done for me personally and for the community.
02:01:47 [W1] So our next presenter is is Cheryl hung Cheryl's a director of ecosystem at the cloud native Computing foundation. And today she's going to give you some updates on the cncf end-user ecosystem, please welcome Cheryl hung.
02:02:13 [W1] Hi everyone, and welcome to keep calm Cloud native calm.
02:02:16 [W1] This is Cheryl hung and I'm very excited to be joining you here from my kitchen.
02:02:23 [W1] She's going to give you some updates on the cncf end user ecosystem, please welcome Cheryl hung.
02:02:41 [W1] Hi everyone, and welcome to keep calm Cloud native calm.
02:02:44 [W1] This is Cheryl hung and I'm very excited to be joining you here from my kitchen.
02:02:57 [W1] But there's somebody who should be here and who isn't and that's Dan Kohn my previous manager one of the founders and executive director of the cncf when I recorded my keynote a few weeks ago.
02:03:11 [W1] None of us knew that he was going to leave us so soon.
02:03:14 [W1] So I wanted to share memory with you first and that's the very first
02:03:58 [W1] Hi everyone, and welcome to keep calm Cloud native come this is Cheryl hung and I'm very excited to be joining you here from my kitchen.
02:04:08 [W1] But there's somebody who should be here and who isn't and that's Dan Kohn my previous manager one of the founders and executive director of the cncf when I recorded my keynote a few weeks ago.
02:04:21 [W1] None of us knew that he was going to leave us so soon.
02:04:25 [W1] So I wanted to share memory with you first and that's the very first time that I spoke to Dan while I was interviewing for cncf.
02:04:34 [W1] But there's somebody who should be here and who isn't and that's done cone.
02:04:39 [W1] my previous manager one of the founders and executive director of the cncf when I recorded my keynote a few weeks ago. None of us knew that he was going to leave us so soon. So I wanted to share memory with you first
02:05:03 [W1] And then he when he picked up the phone to me.
02:05:06 [W1] The first thing he said to me was Cheryl.
02:05:11 [W1] After cncf, you could become the executive director of your own Foundation or you could start a start-up or you could become a VC or you could join one of our member companies and I was so surprised because I was like, aren't I
02:05:26 [W1] You why I'm good enough to do this job.
02:05:28 [W1] Why are you talking about?
02:05:29 [W1] What should happen after I do cncf, but that's how he thought about people and that's how he thought about the community.
02:05:37 [W1] It was never about.
02:05:38 [W1] Are you good enough to do it today?
02:05:41 [W1] He was always about how can I set you up so that in the future you'll be even better and you'll have even more opportunities to do what you want to do for that.
02:05:50 [W1] I'm very grateful and I know many of you who knew Dan are also very grateful.
02:05:57 [W1] And in the spirit of that I'm going to spend the rest of my keynote talking about the training and certification and education upskilling yourself and your team's but I just wanted to say thank you Dan we all miss you.
02:06:19 [W1] Hello everyone and welcome to keep Concord knative Khan.
02:06:22 [W1] I'm Cheryl and I've got two really exciting announcements from cncf certification. One is a new certified kubernative security Specialists. And the second is new training benefits for end user companies.
02:06:35 [W1] All Cube con attendees get a discount on certifications.
02:06:39 [W1] So I wanted to help you understand whether you should spend your time getting certified. Let's talk about
02:06:46 [W1] Three questions who should take certifications?
02:06:50 [W1] What do they cover?
02:06:51 [W1] First who should take certifications certifications are good for many different audiences. According to the 2020 open source jobs reports fund. The Linux Foundation devops is the most sought-after job
02:07:03 [W1] A five percent of companies looking to hire more devops talent and the average salary for a kubernative job in the u.s. Is a hundred and forty eight thousand dollars.
02:07:00 [W1] We've got over 19. Everyone has way more time at home than normal and we have seen incredible growth incredible demand for training and certification 68% of professionals told us that they plan to
02:07:15 [W1] This year which is up significantly from 47 percent in 2018.
02:07:19 [W1] For hiring managers, obviously a certification is not the same as real world experience.
02:07:24 [W1] I definitely know this because when I was a devops manager back in 2017, it was just basically impossible to find anyone with experience running kubernative in production.
02:07:37 [W1] So doing interviews, I would you know, look for cloud native mindset that says person think about releasing frequently.
02:07:43 [W1] Do they think about monitoring their life systems do they think about automation?
02:07:49 [W1] Remember had one really memorable answer to this one candidate said we build our software using containers and Jenkins.
02:07:57 [W1] Okay, all sounds pretty good so far and then we burn our software to DVDs and we ship those DVDs out and I just had this mind-blowing moment because while we have come a long way
02:08:13 [W1] Shipping DVDs through the mail to what people expect nowadays from software and a huge part of that is thanks to the many contributors who have put their time into Cloud native projects a third audience for certification.
02:08:25 [W1] Cloud native projects a third audience for certifications is end users those who are adopting kubenetes and they want to establish a baseline of knowledge across existing teams 74% of hiring managers
02:08:33 [W1] What would need to pay for certifications and one told me we chose to pursue the CK and cked training classes as a way to provide an educational foundation for wide swath of software and platform engineer's
02:08:48 [W1] kubenetes, and is ecosystem
02:08:50 [W1] Kubernative is our main infrastructure platform, and we wanted to set up a kubernative baseline of knowledge for SRE and application engineers.
02:08:59 [W1] And we chose CK and CKD as a community validated approach.
02:09:04 [W1] So what at second question, what do the certifications cover CK a stands for certified kubernative administrator and CKD for certified kubenetes application developer and we
02:09:19 [W1] It to launch the third in the series that is the C KS or certified kubenetes security specialist and it's going to cover six topics cluster set up cost a hardening system hardening minimizing
02:09:33 [W1] Supply chain security monitoring logging and runtime security, but where did these six topics come from?
02:09:36 [W1] So let me tell you this is John Foreman.
02:09:40 [W1] He is a senior technical architecture manager at Accenture and over the last two years.
02:09:45 [W1] He had seen a shift in client questions from what our containers to how do we secure containers and to him that disconnect was because current security tools were not
02:09:58 [W1] Nowhere, so although teams were good at monitoring servers operating systems and network layers.
02:10:04 [W1] The container clusters just consistently went unmonitored.
02:10:08 [W1] So John and his team had been working on this container security reference model for Dev seccomp engineer's which he wanted to share out with the rest of the community.
02:10:19 [W1] So John and I we had a coffee and Q concern Diego and he asked whether cncf would create a new security Focus.
02:10:27 [W1] Ian which would be the gold standard for when companies hire Talent OR encourage their current staff to get certified and I said, yeah, that sounds great because I've also seen the same growing demand for container security
02:10:43 [W1] Open source jobs report degrees after Cloud Technologies and Linux security is the third highest priority knowledge area, but this certification has to be community-driven because it has to reflect security practices across
02:10:57 [W1] please so thanks to Sig security 20 Security Experts from vendors consultancies and end-users volunteer to come together and they discuss the most important tasks that a security specialist
02:11:01 [W1] And that's where these six topics came from and I want to say a huge.
02:11:05 [W1] thank you to John his team and our Security Experts for contributing your time and your expertise to the community because to answer the question of what do certifications cover its the community duh the
02:11:20 [W1] Is decides what is most important last question?
02:11:22 [W1] Is this a fair test?
02:11:24 [W1] And do you need real skills to pass it?
02:11:26 [W1] Well, there's only one way to find out.
02:11:28 [W1] I think I'm going to go and try it myself.
02:11:31 [W1] So let's go over to a laptop.
02:11:36 [W1] Alright, so the first thing that I see here is that it's not QA.
02:11:42 [W1] I actually have a live cluster and a live terminal that I can type into so I'm told that I need to set the configuration context before I start.
02:11:50 [W1] I'm just going to copy and paste that looks like I can switch to the kubernetes context and I am given a task here.
02:11:59 [W1] So my task is to find the pods running on any nodes having a memory limit configured and write the name of
02:12:06 [W1] Pollard with the highest memory limit configured to this file / up / whatever whatever. So my first task I'm going to look at the cluster and look at the nodes with Cube CTL get nodes.
02:12:23 [W1] It's like this is a three node cluster.
02:12:25 [W1] I have kubernative Master zero kubernative node 0 and kubernative Node 1 the next step for me.
02:12:33 [W1] me I think is to look for the pods that are running on each node.
02:12:38 [W1] I'm actually going to pause here and ask what would you do and we'll come back to this solution at the end.
02:12:45 [W1] Configured to this file / up, / whatever whatever. So my first task I'm going to look at the cluster and look at the nodes with Cube CTL get nodes.
02:12:57 [W1] It's like this is a three node cluster.
02:12:59 [W1] I have kubernative Master zuo kubernative node 0 and kubenetes Node 1. The next step for me. I think is to look for the pods that are running on each node.
02:13:12 [W1] I'm actually going to pause here and ask what would you do and we'll come back to this solution at the end.
02:13:21 [W1] So to me, I actually do feel like this is a fair test because you have to be comfortable with a command line with Cube CTL and other tools that are sysadmin would typically use over 15,000 people who have already completed the cka or CKD.
02:13:50 [W1] Me I actually do feel like this is a fair test because you have to be comfortable with a command line with Cube CTL and other tools that are sysadmin would typically use over 15,000 people who have already completed the cka or CKD
02:14:11 [W1] People ugly.
02:14:12 [W1] It's pretty hard one.
02:14:43 [W1] Said we think specifications really valuable and I'll Engineers found the training and exam approach fair and practical as its Performance Based not theoretical so to sum up is it worth getting a certification?
02:14:59 [W1] The company said it best no training is perfect.
02:15:01 [W1] It's not going to make an engineer an expert after 1 week of training but the Hands-On exercises help build muscle memory, which engineer's can leverage in their day-to-day responsibilities, and we want to encourage more people to get certified.
02:15:17 [W1] so all que con attendees get 50% off if you register this week making it $150 instead of $300 and I'm personally really excited to announce new training benefits for end users if your
02:15:26 [W1] Upton kubenetes and you plan to certify a whole team you should join cncf as an end-user member because you're going to get an unlimited training subscription for 15 users +15 exam vouchers for value of up
02:15:35 [W1] Dollars or you can join as an end-user supporter and get 5 training courses or certifications for value of up to $2,500.
02:15:43 [W1] So if you're currently adopting kubernative and you want to improve the training and education options for your team go to cncf dot IO / join.
02:15:55 [W1] Last but not least the solution.
02:15:57 [W1] I didn't forget. So let's go back to the laptop.
02:16:04 [W1] Alright, so here we go. Again. Remember my task was to find the pods on any nodes with the highest memory limit and write the name of the Pod to this file.
02:16:15 [W1] So I already know this is a three node cluster.
02:16:20 [W1] I'm going to do Cube CTL describe node, and look at what is running on each of these nodes.
02:16:29 [W1] Looks like the first one it's called DNS it CD in a bunch of cube Cube containers.
02:16:37 [W1] And the one with the highest memory limit is the core DNS pods with a hundred and seventy. I'm going to do the same again for the kubernative node 0
02:16:52 [W1] do I see anything with more than 170?
02:16:57 [W1] Nope?
02:16:58 [W1] Okay.
02:16:58 [W1] And same again.
02:16:59 [W1] I don't see anything higher than a hundred seventy.
02:17:01 [W1] So if I remember correctly, this is actually a tie there were two pods which both have a hundred and seventy as a memory limit of a hundred seventy.
02:17:10 [W1] Let me take these and I'm going to Echo these into the
02:17:20 [W1] the file that I was told to
02:17:24 [W1] so looks like I've got one and then the second one.
02:17:40 [W1] Okay, and just to confirm that I actually did do it.
02:17:45 [W1] Let me use cats to check this file.
02:17:50 [W1] And yeah all is good.
02:17:52 [W1] Did you get it right if you got it right then well done.
02:17:56 [W1] Happy certifying and have a fantastic people.
02:18:08 [W1] Thank you so much Cheryl next up. We have Alina / her check.
02:18:13 [W1] She is a software engineer at apple and a member of the cncf technical oversight committee.
02:18:20 [W1] And today she'll be sharing some some of apples Journey.
02:18:24 [W1] All is good.
02:18:12 [W1] Did you get it right if you got it right then well done.
02:18:16 [W1] Happy certifying and have a fantastic View.
02:18:28 [W1] Thank you so much Cheryl next up. We have Alina / her Chuck.
02:18:33 [W1] She is a software engineer at apple and a member of the cncf technical oversight committee. And today she'll be sharing some some of apples Journey.
02:18:44 [W1] It's a cloud native, which I'm super excited about, please welcome Elena.
02:19:04 [W1] Hello everyone.
02:19:05 [W1] My name is Alina and I work for Apple.
02:19:07 [W1] I joined the company as a software engineer about a year ago to work on kubernative and Cloud native projects since then so many people from the open source Community have asked me what attracted me the most to my new job and the answer is easy.
02:19:33 [W1] Hello everyone.
02:19:34 [W1] My name is Alina and I work for Apple.
02:19:37 [W1] I joined the company as a software engineer about a year ago to work on kubernative and Cloud native projects since then so many people from the open source Community have asked me what attracted me the most to my new job and the answer is easy.
02:19:56 [W1] The cloud infrastructure and the variety of applications running on it before I mainly focus on kubenetes clusters provisioning.
02:20:04 [W1] I thought that looking at things from the application and end user and got scale would help to complete the circle.
02:20:10 [W1] So here I am.
02:20:12 [W1] When you join a new team or company getting to know its history helps to understand current decisions and trade-offs measures has been used at Apple for over five years with an internally build container orchestrator called grpc.
02:20:25 [W1] It had a good reputation as a scheduling platform and it's killed well to support multiple Frameworks for running a variety of services like by stateful and stateless, but the container orchestrator soon became a bottleneck for
02:20:40 [W1] And so we started considering other choices.
02:20:43 [W1] In addition to masses Apple use some other solutions for compute management along with the transition. We wanted to consolidate them and provide the unified platform for better capacity utilization.
02:20:54 [W1] We found that kubernative was an obvious winner as an orchestrator.
02:21:01 [W1] With kubernative being more generic in pluggable.
02:21:04 [W1] it meant we could better divide work mountains the decisions on what provider to choose four core components like storage in time and network.
02:21:13 [W1] We're no longer life or death decisions.
02:21:15 [W1] We knew that it was just a plug-in choice and the choice could always be re-evaluated without refactoring the entire system.
02:21:22 [W1] Another big point of Attraction for developers was an ability to extend kubernative zp eyes and core functionality by leveraging cri-o.
02:21:31 [W1] And custom controllers the kubernative community was a huge asset to the platform its transparency and power was so obvious and provided a great level of comfort to developers.
02:21:44 [W1] The goal was to meet the demand of diverse user.
02:21:48 [W1] Please we had teams who were already successfully running kubernative clusters in their organization and we had people who had never worked with kubernetes before but trusted the technology and wanted to adopt it when the change of this magnitude
02:22:04 [W1] The communities Community was a huge asset to the platform its transparency and power was so obvious and provided a great level of comfort to Developers.
02:22:09 [W1] The goal was to meet the demand of diverse user.
02:22:14 [W1] Peace we had teams who were already successfully running kubernative clusters in their organization, and we had people who had never worked with kubernetes before but trusted the technology and wanted to adopted when the change of this magnitude
02:22:47 [W1] it is important to be honest about
02:23:07 [W1] the trade-offs that need to be made for successful migration.
02:23:12 [W1] It is a known fact that kubernative learning curve is steep. Not only for end users but for platform developers to
02:23:20 [W1] All the platform features that were built in the past had to be re-evaluated is the features current design aligned with the cloud native best practices.
02:23:29 [W1] is this feature even relevant to the new platform asking and answering these questions can be uncomfortable for people and software is built by people.
02:23:39 [W1] We had to accept the fact that there would be a need for a change to the current processes and people would have to adapt
02:23:47 [W1] we realized the impact of the decision. We were ready to invest in training resources and provide full support for developers anything to make that option successful at that point with the net is became our platform choice for compute management terrible.
02:24:03 [W1] Our Target goal is to make the majority of Apple workloads run on kubernative.
02:24:08 [W1] And software is built by people.
02:24:10 [W1] We had to accept the fact that there would be a need for a change to the current processes and people would have to adapt.
02:24:18 [W1] We realized the impact of the decision.
02:24:20 [W1] We were ready to invest in training resources and provide full support for developers anything to make that option successful at that point with the net is became our platform choice for compute management at Apple.
02:24:34 [W1] Our Target goal is to make the majority of Apple workloads run on kubernative.
02:24:39 [W1] We want to maintain end-user Focus while building the platform that required us to understand and categorize our platform users to establish common patterns for hardware and software infrastructure planning.
02:24:54 [W1] One category of users are Java python go developers who want to test and run their applications in the containers. Another category are applications s eries whose focus is on building Advanced deployment workflows for their teams.
02:25:24 [W1] for structure planning
02:25:26 [W1] one category of users are Java python go developers who want to test and run their applications in the containers?
02:25:33 [W1] Another category are applications s eries whose focus is on building Advanced deployment workflows for their teams.
02:25:41 [W1] Another example is hard work. We engineer's who are not afraid to try new things and explore Creative Solutions using Cloud native tools anything to make it easier for Hardware teams to validate devices.
02:25:55 [W1] their machine learning and watch workloads Engineers who utilize the plot from daily running thousands of but jobs that use both CPU and GPU use for training machine learning models Finance is also a platform user as they're a big part of placement decisions and
02:26:10 [W1] Neighing all of this users want to adopt Cloud native tools for better debugging logging monitoring and tracing for their apps.
02:26:18 [W1] Our responsibility as flowed from developers is to provide a scalable artist raishin layer.
02:26:24 [W1] secure resource isolation and reliable scheduling building high level abstractions and CLI tools is also necessary for the plot from success and adoption.
02:26:36 [W1] So we have this big infrastructure pool of compute and storage resources managed by Kudo. Nerys providing it to users can be done in two ways cluster has a service and namespace as a service.
02:26:50 [W1] namespace is a service is our primary model today as I re managers multi-tenant kubernative clusters and user appears in one or multiple namespaces.
02:27:01 [W1] This way users do not have an overhead of infrastructure management and configuration.
02:27:06 [W1] Focus on application deployment and development.
02:27:09 [W1] However, we realize that in the world workloads Structural Engineering has been commodified some teams may still want cluster as a service.
02:27:19 [W1] With a goal of centralized capacity control we had to obstruct Resource Management to its own system. We wanted to make it as G Eric as possible to streamline the solution for the hybrid cloud in the future.
02:27:31 [W1] That is provided to users can be done in two ways cluster as a service and namespace as a service namespaces a service is our primary model today as I re managers multi-tenant kubernative
02:29:55 [W1] Location resource isolation would be handled by assigning priority and quarter to each workloads.
02:30:15 [W1] Even with a namespace as a service constraints we wanted users to have a freedom to choose Cloud native tools to run in there namespaces. Some of these tools require crd is a cluster level resource.
02:30:27 [W1] We had to think of a proper ci/cd management flow to make the deployment possible.
02:30:33 [W1] Solving this technical challenges would not have been possible without the wide array of cloud native tools those we use on the platform level and those who recommend to application Developers.
02:30:44 [W1] This list is not complete.
02:32:13 [W1] And keeps on growing as we constantly evaluate new projects and find more areas for development and integration.
02:32:21 [W1] With all the careful planning only running things at scale could reveal certain issues.
02:32:26 [W1] We have chosen open source, kubernative probe test cluster Lauder to the challenge. Our cluster is developers can always write their own framework, but we found cluster elotl been quite profile. We wanted to engage more with the
02:32:41 [W1] As time and fixing and expanding the existing tool that could be used by others.
02:32:37 [W1] Another area of emitted Focus was scheduling we run mixed types of workloads and kubernative including Bosch workloads and want to maintain a reasonable resource utilization participating in six scheduling and contributing back is very important to
02:32:52 [W1] You want to stay as close to the Upstream as possible for some people in our team.
02:32:46 [W1] It was their very first experience contributing to Upstream kubernative going through the process of joining sick for discussions filing first, kubernative these issues and recognizing the various ways to help the community. It was all new and exciting.
02:33:00 [W1] I would like to share some of our current priorities.
02:33:04 [W1] In a multi-tenant environment many customers workloads around on the same machine to meet security requirements and provide isolation between mix level of trust a common pattern is to leverage defense in depth.
02:33:18 [W1] We are seeking to enable this level of isolation with micro VMS with that multiple untrusting tenants can run on the same notes and share the same control plane while continuing to provide two layers of isolation virtual machine and
02:33:33 [W1] Plus there is a certain is comes to the cost of increased Security Management resource utilization in efficiency and operational burden in the company's of Apple scale as a result.
02:33:44 [W1] We started exploring alternative models like virtual clusters with virtual cluster user self services virtualized kubernative control and data plane on top of shared kubernative infrastructure.
02:33:56 [W1] eliminates the majority of security and attritional concerns.
02:34:01 [W1] With the deployment footprint growth and distribution cross data centers comes the demand for multi cluster workloads management.
02:34:09 [W1] We are researching on API haproxy solution offer improved self healing utilization efficiency high level abstractions and developer workflow experiences for teams that manage workloads across multiple clusters.
02:34:21 [W1] We want to reduce the plot from complexity for developers and operators at the same time. We want to maintain high security standards and low resource utilization.
02:34:31 [W1] So we are investing in function as a service solution leveraging server site webassembly to solve this.
02:34:38 [W1] With a constant editions of the new features and user workloads observability becomes one of the top priorities. We want to keep the platform management saying as the platform growth
02:34:50 [W1] And user productivity and happiness is our end goal.
02:35:46 [W1] Adopting new technology on such a big scale often comes hand in hand with organizational changes.
02:35:52 [W1] You need to change everything and everyone from managers and finance to tag teams and yourself.
02:35:59 [W1] It is a long road with a lot of growing pains our security team grew and took on extra responsibilities.
02:36:07 [W1] Ensuring security and multi-tenant cluster is not a trivial task.
02:36:11 [W1] Adopting new technology on such a big scale often comes hand in hand with organizational changes.
02:36:15 [W1] You need to change everything and everyone from managers and finance to tag teams and yourself.
02:36:21 [W1] It is a long road with a load of growing pains our security team grew and took on extra responsibilities.
02:36:30 [W1] Insurance security and multi-tenant cluster is not a trivial task.
02:36:33 [W1] We had to have a clear separation of concern between application security and kubernative platform security to maintain a shared responsibility model.
02:36:43 [W1] One of our goals was to rethink about City Planning having a dedicated resource management team working close with the finance department was necessary. Some new teams were formed some grew in size and responsibilities and some
02:37:00 [W1] security to maintain a shared responsibility model
02:37:04 [W1] One of our goals was to rethink about City Planning having a dedicated resource management team working close with the finance department was necessary. Some new teams were formed some grew in size and responsibilities and some
02:37:20 [W1] S every team used to be more operational and systems focused now, it has an emphasis on engineering and a much stronger voice in the platform architectural design having a solid and stable platform made it possible to maintain focus on the
02:37:35 [W1] and innovate Foster
02:37:37 [W1] Innovation is impossible without collaboration Forum in a cross team technical review board for cloud native based projects was invaluable to us.
02:37:46 [W1] It is a safe place to get peer feedback from people having different backgrounds.
02:37:52 [W1] Some have more experience with developing features for kubernative and some have a deep expertise in a particular technical domain like security getting their combined input is extremely useful during the design stage.
02:38:05 [W1] With a shared platform shared information becomes a necessity.
02:38:08 [W1] We are likely to have a dedicated team managing inner source and open source initiatives here at Apple the team focuses on internal trainings on cloud native and Kudo knative advises people who want to start making their first open source contributions
02:38:23 [W1] I'm cheered information becomes a necessity.
02:38:24 [W1] We are likely to have a dedicated team managing inner source and open source initiatives here at Apple the team focuses on internal trainings on cloud native and kubernative advises people who want to start making their first open source contributions
02:38:49 [W1] For those who have been contributing for to open source for a while.
02:38:54 [W1] The team helps to connect people and grow both internal and external collaborations.
02:39:01 [W1] The ongoing transformation leaves a very little time for reflection, but the reflection is always necessary migration is not something everyone wants to do but those who invest in the modernizing their application and the platform benefit in the future by
02:39:16 [W1] Loud knative technologists on top of the foundation.
02:39:19 [W1] Migration at scale has taught us to embrace the community best practices and shared learnings.
02:39:25 [W1] We wanted to give back and have realized that engagement comes in many forms writing code serving on Toc board for cncf helping kubernative release team improving documentation file in issues and many more
02:39:40 [W1] Engagement comes in many forms writing code serving on Toc board for cncf helping kubernative release team improving documentation file in issues and many more Innovation is driven by sharing and collaboration.
02:40:06 [W1] And is driven by sharing and collaboration sharing with the broader community in the open source sharing with another team in your company through the inner Source helps to enable reuse of existing Solutions and minimize the redundancy even
02:40:21 [W1] Helps to enable reuse of existing Solutions and minimize the redundancy. Even Small Change can begin to make larger cultural change a reality.
02:40:30 [W1] We have realized that in the end the migration changes not just a technical stackrox, but the people involved in it.
02:40:37 [W1] Please reach out to us if you have any questions, thank you.
02:40:47 [W1] Thank you Elena.
02:40:48 [W1] Just also for anyone who is new to this to Kook on especially since we can't do round of applause. Don't forget to do the virtual clapping within the slack Channel.
02:40:59 [W1] All right, so use those waves also Priyanka and Cheryl should definitely get a college as well since we haven't had a chance to give them a round of applause.
02:41:07 [W1] I also want to give all of you a round of applause for turning this into a low test.
02:41:13 [W1] all working on addressing.
02:41:17 [W1] Without pausing issues. So just let you know that we were seeing it and we are addressing it and we are working to get this back as soon as possible. And now for our next presenter, our next presenter is Diane Mueller.
02:41:30 [W1] She is the director of Community Development at red hat and today Diane will discuss the impact end users are making on open source and have a canoe sure that success please welcome Diane Mueller and give her a round of applause.
02:41:43 [W1] Red hat, and I'm really excited to be here today to talk with you about.
02:42:27 [W1] Hey everybody.
02:42:28 [W1] I'm Diane dealer and I'm the director of Community Development at red hat and I'm really excited to be here today to talk with you about end users and more specifically about the phenomenal rise in participation of end users in open source communities across the cloud native ecosystem in many ways. This is
02:42:43 [W1] her to end users in my way of expressing my virtual gratitude for all the many contributions that end users have made that have helped Drive Innovation into the projects and products and services that I and the rest of red hat have had the privilege to work on in collaboration
02:42:50 [W1] / in the audience today over the past years like many of you open source fuels my work. It gives me a mission allows me to contribute to make
02:42:59 [W1] the world a better place and hopefully to be a catalyst for others to participate and contribute to building a better world for all of us. We have barely scratched the surface of the eye.
02:45:00 [W1] opportunity that is ahead of us as we all know open source has a future and the rise in end user participation has enabled us to dramatically scale and accelerate what we're doing today to continue to do so, we need to evolve and nurture that
02:45:23 [W1] Virtuous end user cycle that Priyanka Sharma so eloquently pointed out at the last can comb and this will ensure all of our successes and help all of us grow. Our communities today end users are not just giving feedback.
02:45:36 [W1] They're building side by side with us. We have projects like metal cube that while it may have sprung from Red Hat now is key maintainers and dedicated engineering resources from Erickson working full-time to
02:45:57 [W1] Drive this project for we've seen major donations of fully formed projects and code bases such as Jaeger and Uber and Envoy from lift and backstage from Spotify and many more that are evidenced in the cncf landscape.
02:46:12 [W1] Red Hat now is key maintainers and dedicated engineering resources from Erickson working full-time to
02:46:26 [W1] Drive this project forward we've seen major donations of fully formed projects and code bases such as Jaeger and Uber and Envoy from lift and backstage from Spotify and many more that are evidenced in the cncf landscape.
02:46:40 [W1] that is literally bursting at the seams with projects filling the sandboxes and launching themselves and GitHub repos, and we're now seeing a new emerging trend of end users sharing up the stack and openly discussing their workloads and how they've implemented.
02:46:54 [W1] Such as with Telco is like America movil and their Enterprise neurosystem initiative in which they're sharing their AI Ops expertise and implementation to bring more efficiency to all of their Enterprises using the open source way.
02:47:08 [W1] They're taking Enterprise and Industry specific user groups to an entirely new level.
02:47:16 [W1] And while vendors continue including Red Hat divided to be seen as the top contributors and engineering resources dedicated to a cncf projects and believe me. We are all grateful for those continued contributions.
02:47:29 [W1] So please do all keep bracing for that Top Notch the real Trend that we should be proud of and to continue to nurture can be seen further down in the dev stats and the stack analytics and other dashboards is in the huge rise of
02:47:44 [W1] Actively participating in our working groups at all level I'd be hugely remiss if I didn't give a shout out and thank you to all the end-user participants in the openshift communities and especially those in the okd working group that are helping Drive the collaboration across
02:47:59 [W1] If I didn't give a shout out and thank you to the all the end-user participants in the openshift communities and especially those in the okd working group that are helping Drive the collaboration across openshift okd Fedora core OS and operators and lots of others.
02:48:14 [W1] Fedora core OS and operators and lots of others, you know, that's I'm hugely grateful for that and it wouldn't be possible without the end user participation and contributions.
02:48:27 [W1] There are now end users on the cncf TOC and on the board and in this and you can see them in the cncf end user Community initiatives and creating these spaces isn't hugely important to give them voice, but there's
02:48:42 [W1] It's more work to be done as not all end users and corporations are able to participate yet.
02:48:48 [W1] We've seen peer to peer coaching from those that are participating.
02:48:53 [W1] we've seen the rise of Enterprises launching their own open source program offices like at Salesforce and in at Apple and the creation of rules, like open source officers at Bosch
02:49:09 [W1] The more we can do to help or their organizations and their management teams understand the value of open information and Innovation the more resources they can bring to the party.
02:49:21 [W1] Projects like that of the cncf contributor to contributor Sig that's doing great work on creating clear pass from boarding participants into our communities need to be raised up and made more visible their work around embedding and creating clear
02:49:36 [W1] Unity's need to be raised up and made more visible their work around embedding and creating clear contribution letters ladders so that the path from newbie to maintain Andrews clear and open and inclusive
02:49:49 [W1] Many projects already have well-trodden well-documented pass like Helm and Envoy and now Porter's got a great one I call on all of the project leads out of our communities and others to revisit and talk to the end
02:50:04 [W1] Coming year to ensure their projects have well-documented paths or onboarding and growing their maintainers.
02:50:11 [W1] This will ensure the sustainability and health of all their efforts and all of our efforts open source open formats. Open Standards have not only changed technology.
02:50:20 [W1] They've also changed our society for good the role of end users in this cannot be understated by nurturing and making spaces for end users. We have the opportunity to accelerate this work at a greater scale and show
02:50:34 [W1] everyone that open really does unlock the world's potential.
02:50:40 [W1] So thank you.
02:50:41 [W1] We look forward to continuing to collaborate with all of you across the ecosystem.
02:50:45 [W1] Have a great coupon stay open. They safe be well.
02:50:55 [W1] Thank you so much Diane.
02:50:57 [W1] I love the message about the end user community and I hope to see more of you in and around Cloud native projects.
02:51:04 [W1] So next up we have constants.
02:51:07 [W1] my silly co-chair partner in crime for for promos and other things Constance is a principle software engineer at Splunk and she will be talking about cncf project updates today.
02:51:21 [W1] Take it away.
02:51:30 [W1] I'm Constance caramel has and I'll be doing your cncf project updates today.
02:51:36 [W1] Before we get started.
02:51:37 [W1] I want to talk a little bit about something. We're changing this time try and see how it goes as you'll notice during this Kook on cloud native con. There's an increased focus on telling end user stories and we're going to continue that theme here today during project updates.
02:51:50 [W1] Let's get started.
02:51:54 [W1] Our first project and talk about is Falco Falco is a runtime security project and it consumed signals from the Linux kernel and container management tools such as Doctrine kubernative Falco Parsons these signals and assert some again security rules.
02:52:09 [W1] Was violated our Learners triggered?
02:51:51 [W1] Now, let's look at some of the cool statistics that have happened in the past year.
02:51:56 [W1] One there have been over seven hundred thousand downloads of the kernel module in 10 days.
02:52:03 [W1] That's an amazing number 60 new contributors this year and these contributors come from companies like IBM covr Shopify AWS appdynamics in a team really wide variety of contributors. That's amazing.
02:52:20 [W1] There are 12 adopters and many independent users. Now what have been some updates to the project.
02:52:27 [W1] One is a user space driver additions such as support for fargate workloads using p dig support for armed 64 arm7.
02:52:36 [W1] Yes, that means lower energy processing.
02:52:41 [W1] Stability / improvements to the Falco engine for better performance additional Community Integrations such as Falco sidekick and a growing number of additional Community creations.
02:52:54 [W1] And there's been some user adoption improvements such as improved Helm charts Falco CTL vocal cuddle.
02:53:02 [W1] I'm going to need someone to correct that for me afterwards Falco exporter for Prometheus and Improvement generators event generators.
02:53:09 [W1] Gordon this is really wonderful to see in terms of end user.
02:53:08 [W1] I will not be able to do justice to shame Lawrence and Chris nóva if you didn't have a chance, I highly suggest for you to look to watch their keynote from EU Shane Lawrence comes from Shopify and he describes
02:53:24 [W1] What how Shopify uses Falco to give you the TLD W the too long didn't watch Shopify uses Falco and it's rule sets in production for detection and prevention.
02:53:20 [W1] It does things such as detecting data egress example coredns mining metadata server abuse and a remote code execution output.
02:53:29 [W1] Please check out their keynote. They will do much better description of how things are done. Thank you.
02:53:38 [W1] Shopify Shane Lawrence and Chris Nobles overdoing Kuma you and thank you Falco.
02:53:46 [W1] On to our next project Thanos Thanos is a Prometheus base scalable time series data base that provides a global query View High availability and data backup with historical cheap access as its core features all
02:54:01 [W1] single binary
02:54:04 [W1] they say it is three years old.
02:54:07 [W1] They have 281 contributors and direct quote from the maintainers.
02:54:11 [W1] They are very grateful for that.
02:54:12 [W1] Thank you contributors.
02:54:13 [W1] There are sixty five hundred stargazers and in 2020, they focus on mentoring.
02:54:21 [W1] They had nine students.
02:54:23 [W1] came from programs like cncf Community bridge and Google summer of code, and they had a really positive impact on the project. I'll mention one of their additions in a minute.
02:54:34 [W1] And they have high commit velocity over the past year.
02:54:37 [W1] They've been averaging six commits per day.
02:54:39 [W1] This is amazing.
02:54:40 [W1] This is a chart here on the right that I want to see for everyone.
02:54:44 [W1] This is just great work everyone.
02:54:47 [W1] What about some updates?
02:54:50 [W1] So we need to give us a nose around of Applause that virtual Round of Applause and sock everyone.
02:54:56 [W1] It has reached incubation status and April 20 20.
02:55:00 [W1] Congratulations Thanos community.
02:55:01 [W1] That is great work.
02:55:04 [W1] They've added support for knative response cache and collaboration with cortex project.
02:55:08 [W1] Another thing.
02:55:09 [W1] I want to highlight collaboration with other projects.
02:55:12 [W1] This makes me really happy to see it is, you know, we are all providing solutions for the cognitive world and seeing this collaboration just makes me really happy.
02:55:23 [W1] They've added new react you eyes to all components.
02:55:26 [W1] This is also a really big thank you to the community and to the mentees.
02:55:32 [W1] There is a heavy focus on analytics olap Integrations through absolute. Exclaim Unity sub-project.
02:55:39 [W1] There's offer full multi-tenancy. This allows for flexible deployment of various read storage and right tendency.
02:55:48 [W1] And the root of the limitation of from career prom cool single CPU concurrency and Prometheus.
02:55:53 [W1] That means it's multi-core.
02:55:56 [W1] It has sped up querying.
02:55:57 [W1] thank you Thanos. Let's talk about Rook.
02:56:04 [W1] Now we have to give Rook around of Applause. They graduated earlier this year.
02:56:12 [W1] Rook provides an open source storage solution for kubernative use through operators in C RDS. It automates management of storage providers including ceph NFS Cassandra cockroach DB and yugabyte DB.
02:56:27 [W1] There are over 7800 stargazers.
02:56:32 [W1] 295 contributors the ones you want me to say again.
02:56:36 [W1] Thank you to The Rook community maintainers.
02:56:41 [W1] Over a hundred eighty million downloads amazing.
02:56:45 [W1] And most recently there's really Savvy 1.5 and it contains improvements such as support for Stuff stretch clusters encryption with KMS and mirroring block data across clusters.
02:57:00 [W1] Now the next end-user I'm really excited about well, so because it's not, you know, we don't really hear so much about research and education use cases.
02:57:08 [W1] So the Pacific research platform project is a partnership across many many institutions both at the governmental level National Science Foundation Department of energy and also multiple research universities
02:57:23 [W1] In the United States and around the world.
02:57:25 [W1] So PRP aims to create a seamless research platform that encourages collaboration on a broad range of data intensive fields and projects now naturally using karate has was a good idea for that.
02:57:40 [W1] So they run a kubernative cluster.
02:57:42 [W1] It's mostly located in California, but also other parts of the country and they have some nodes and Pacific Asian region in Europe.
02:57:48 [W1] All of this is connected through a with a fast ten hundred Deer research Network.
02:57:56 [W1] Now this cluster incorporates Force F clusters managed by Rook to petabyte-scale in the u.s.
02:58:02 [W1] Western region five hundred terabytes in u.s.
02:58:05 [W1] Eastern Region 8 terabytes video wall SSD only local a hundred 30 terabytes nvme only local and soon to be added in asia-pacific fool.
02:58:18 [W1] now the following is a direct quote from PRP about how Rook has enabled them to be successful Rook is tremendously helping us to deploy a reliably a reliable fast or too scientific users Rook makes administration of a large
02:58:46 [W1] Relations easier and remove multi multiple tasks of nodes management from personnel which helps reduce costs and increase efficiency data storage is a key component of scientific Computing computations and Rook does a perfectly for us. Thank you.
02:59:01 [W1] P and thank you Rick for sharing.
02:59:05 [W1] I'm to the last project we're going to talk about today is the test.
02:59:09 [W1] The test is a database solution for deploying scaling and managing large clusters of Open Source database instances It Sports MySQL and mariadb it is architected to run as effectively on public or private Cloud architecture as it
02:59:24 [W1] Dedicated hardware and it combines and extends many important SQL features of the scalability of nosql database.
02:59:31 [W1] And so some of the things problems, you know that I tries to solve our scaling SQL database by sharding it migrating from bare metal to private private or public Cloud not reliably as one word was trying to say and
02:59:47 [W1] pulling in managing a large number of scale SQL database instances
02:59:53 [W1] One fun fact that I know about before is of a Tesla was actually running on kubernative.
02:59:59 [W1] Zat YouTube before kubernative 1.0 around for a while. That's awesome.
03:00:05 [W1] In terms of some updates there been four major releases this year and the latest release 8.0 is compatible with over 10 modern SQL Frameworks, including WordPress and Ruby on Rails active record.
03:00:19 [W1] And for last 10 years our story slack, so the beginning of 2017 slack began adoption of a test.
03:00:29 [W1] by in August of 2017.
03:00:33 [W1] It started serving production traffic.
03:00:37 [W1] After completing a re-architecture and migration of slacks core product features by early 2020 roughly Center Center traffic was passing through the tests, and they had designed a framework to migrate one table at a time. Now, you're probably wondering what about
03:00:52 [W1] Reading 30% and that is the Crux of the problem.
03:00:56 [W1] They had done a calculation that it would take three to five years at least for engineers to migrate the remaining 30% of the Legacy system.
03:01:05 [W1] And that's a really long time. Now, they knew it was going to take a while and so in 2019, they spend effort investigating alternative strategy or alternative strategies to do the migration and what they found was if
03:01:20 [W1] Leveraging of your application functionality that they can migrate entire clusters to the test.
03:01:26 [W1] Now this resulted in as of now the 99% of traffic at slac uses the test and that the migration will be complete by end of year.
03:01:39 [W1] And just to share direct quote we moved hundreds of terabytes of data over a thousand MySQL shards zero downtime not a single outage equally important.
03:01:50 [W1] It was transparent her applications. Thank you so much for sharing and thank you for tests.
03:01:56 [W1] Now before we cut off for a moment, I want to call us another graduations take Abby.
03:02:05 [W1] TUF the update framework
03:02:09 [W1] Harbor
03:02:11 [W1] And Helm, these are other projects that have graduated since we all met together in San Diego last year.
03:02:17 [W1] Please give them a virtual Round of Applause.
03:02:18 [W1] Use those slack emojis, please congratulations to the community contributors maintainers a lot of hard work and it's well earned.
03:02:29 [W1] At our last Mets last message of the day.
03:02:31 [W1] Please go to cncf dot IO / projects to get a full list of all the different projects that are supported and also use leverage maintainer track session the meet the maintainers.
03:02:42 [W1] Sure, you probably have a lot of questions.
03:02:44 [W1] And so please use this time to reach out to find out what's going on with the project and asked, you know get answers to your questions.
03:02:51 [W1] Thank you very much everyone and have good coupon by.
03:03:01 [W1] Thank you so much constants for those project updates.
03:03:04 [W1] So exciting to see all the activity happening across the landscape next up. We have dr.
03:03:11 [W1] Shin Jang. He is a VP of volcano engine at bite dance and we'll be talking about volcano engines Cloud native Journey, please welcome. Dr. Zhang.
03:03:40 [W1] I'm a VP of volcano engine are by dance.
03:03:44 [W1] I feel very honored to be here to present to you about what we do why and how we approach it?
03:03:51 [W1] by August 20 2013 the most popular short video content platform in China has reached 600 million da you or daily active user and the Mau or monthly active user of all Biden's apps
03:04:07 [W1] Has reached 1.5 billion globally we're talking about the Rockies big growth here.
03:04:13 [W1] Given the huge amount of Diversified content and information are platforms carry and for though in this video content aggregation editing analysis and a recommendation.
03:04:24 [W1] are highly relevant with real-time distributed storage Computing capacity and orchestration.
03:04:33 [W1] It has never been an easy task to manage them all at a such scalability.
03:04:40 [W1] Over time we have generated a coherent framework that works from the infrastructure operating system level to meet platform then end-to-end sweets for growth that can also be paired with various industrialized
03:04:55 [W1] Illusions such capabilities and the methodology have been quickly serving the needs of various business lines or units in by dance over the past eight years, as you know Hotel doughy were the early ones and
03:05:10 [W1] And data mobile Etc.
03:05:12 [W1] Now all these come in combo in volcano engine.
03:05:17 [W1] We call this coherent framework one set and with these sweets and capabilities.
03:05:23 [W1] Volcano engine has boosted by dense growth in the past in the similar manner were thinking we can help other companies or Enterprises to grow by using the same set of core Technologies and the best practices.
03:05:38 [W1] That's the essence and the mission of volcano engine as mentioned during the years.
03:05:44 [W1] We have built all these phenomenal apps like though in we have been faced with the growth of millions of users and content.
03:05:52 [W1] need cloudevents.
03:06:07 [W1] And on lots of times we need to go against the traditional go to habits of building apps from static and monolithic to achieve scalability in a cloud knative way from our experience
03:06:22 [W1] Clown native in production.
03:06:24 [W1] It's not only about shifting a single app or as data set up to the cloud or automating certain tasks or integration.
03:06:31 [W1] It's about seriously having the whole business to the cloud native level a complete transformation that involves technical procedural and sometimes even organizational challenges.
03:06:44 [W1] While Ken anjan has been going the clown 84 way since very early on build on the half million notes scale.
03:06:51 [W1] We're dealing with we gain experience and had valuable and vital lessons, which could be also useful to companies and developers in the community who are going through the same Cloud native transformation and confusion
03:07:06 [W1] We're interested to share and exchange this information and insight with the community friends. And at the same time, we'd love to continue to contribute to the open source projects including kubernative kubeflow.
03:07:19 [W1] Not only the cloud native oxygen projects, but also those relevant with data-driven goals
03:07:28 [W1] and the debut on the cube can't stake today is a very important milestone for volcano engine to present its cloudevents Tory. We hope to connect with every one of you in the community to inspire creativity and in reach our
03:07:43 [W1] knative life
03:07:49 [W1] Thank you.
03:07:49 [W1] Thank you.
03:07:49 [W1] Thank you.
03:07:49 [W1] Thank you.
03:07:50 [W1] Thank you. Dr. Shin Jang.
03:07:51 [W1] Don't forget do round of applauses in the Keynotes Channel or the hallway.
03:07:55 [W1] Just leave the event help desk for any questions.
03:07:58 [W1] But thank you. Once again, dr.
03:08:00 [W1] Shin Jang.
03:08:00 [W1] Our next presenter is Brianna Frank.
03:08:03 [W1] Brianna is the director of product at IBM cloud and today she'll discuss how communities everywhere can ultimately power 5 G tellers blanking and distribute analytics, please welcome, Brianna Frank.
03:08:40 [W1] Hi, I'm Brianna Frank.
03:08:41 [W1] I am the director of product at IBM cloud and I'm so excited to be here at coupon 2020.
03:08:48 [W1] So today I'm going to talk about this concept of kubernative.
03:08:51 [W1] He's but needed everywhere and I'm going to walk you through a few real world examples that I'm seeing across a couple different Industries where kubernative he's is needed, but it's needed in lots of different locations.
03:09:04 [W1] So the first example is in the financial industry and on the surface the financial industry might seem like it's all about money, but it's really all about technology in order to compete financial institutions need to create exceptional user experiences.
03:09:20 [W1] And they leverage Ai and trading algorithms to help stay ahead of the market, but it is also a very heavily regulated industry and so Financial Services clients need to iterate quickly leveraging Cloud native tools and best practices.
03:09:35 [W1] Is but they need to be able to keep that data secure and compliant in sometimes that means they might have there might be some restrictions on where that data can live.
03:09:48 [W1] So here's a scenario that's emerging to solve that problem distributed cloud or kubernative as a service anywhere and you know Gartner refers to it as distributed Cloud IDC calls it local Cloud as a service, but this is a
03:10:03 [W1] And to have where the public cloud is now extended to lots of different locations different public Cloud examples on-prem examples or even at the edge and so the key Point here is that distributed Cloud enables you to take advantage
03:10:18 [W1] Of a public Cloud consumption model but in many different locations and you don't have to be an expert in running these software Stacks to run them outside of the public cloud.
03:10:29 [W1] So let's take a look at an example of this concept of kubernative everywhere in action.
03:10:36 [W1] And so, you know in this example, one of our clients is really focused on worker safety.
03:10:42 [W1] And so they're leveraging distributed analytics to keep workers safe.
03:10:47 [W1] So in this scenario, you know, you might have a business or an office building that is actually under construction and you need to be able to leverage video analytics to tell if someone is wearing a hard hat or not and workloads.
03:10:59 [W1] In them before they move into a potentially dangerous area that building. So in this scenario you want to use video analytics, but you really can't have any latency because if you warn someone too late, they could possibly be injured or hurt.
03:11:15 [W1] So let's take a look at how this scenario might works.
03:11:20 [W1] So if you think about solving a safety problem, you need to be able to analyze video data from many cameras all over the office building and it's impractical to send all of that data back to the cloud to be processed remotely.
03:11:32 [W1] So for this scenario to work, well it would be better the video processing were to happen closer to the device.
03:11:39 [W1] So traditionally to do that. It would require you to install servers and software and manage them on.
03:11:45 [W1] Prem with kubernetes and distributed Cloud we can extend the public Cloud into the office so we can leverage cloud services to run this application close to the the device and that's critical so we can reduce latency and we can effectively warn someone.
03:12:00 [W1] Fine if they enter a dangerous area, so now what's interesting is that same workers scenario and client is having to evolve and you know because of covid there are new demands and new challenges that we have to adapt to
03:12:15 [W1] And so now that same client instead of having to warn someone about a hard hat.
03:12:21 [W1] We're really worried about making sure folks are wearing masks and making sure folks are wearing masks correctly and that the mask hasn't slipped Down Under the nose.
03:12:28 [W1] We're also leveraging thermal devices to take someone's temperature before they enter a congested area and we're also using video analytics to see how much usage is happening in a specific room and an office building
03:12:43 [W1] Or even a hospital so we can determine if that room needs to be sanitized.
03:12:48 [W1] So this is an example where you know, we had a really interesting, you know worker safety use case, but we're having to iterate quickly due to real world demands and some of these demands were hard to predict and so we have to be able to react quickly
03:13:03 [W1] And using this Cloud native best practices, but applying them to the edge.
03:13:08 [W1] Thank you so much for listening. If you'd like to learn more about kubernative everywhere go to IBM dot Biz flash coupon 2020.
03:13:17 [W1] Thank you so much and enjoy the rest of coupon.
03:13:31 [W1] Thank you, Brianna.
03:13:32 [W1] Keep the round of applause coming in the keynote annulled and next speaker.
03:13:37 [W1] He will definitely not be mr.
03:13:39 [W1] To our next presenter is Steven Augustus.
03:13:43 [W1] He is a senior open source engine RPM where he is also my co-chair and today he'll be giving some updates on kubernative, please welcome Steven Augustus.
03:14:02 [W1] Hello.
03:14:02 [W1] Hello everyone.
03:14:03 [W1] My name is Steven Augustus. And I am one of your co-chairs for Kube con Cloud knative Khan and a virtual.
03:14:09 [W1] I'm here to talk to you about the kubernative project and we're going to do some project updates. So let's jump into it.
03:14:19 [W1] Now the kubernative project is comprised of people and we believe in and we care deeply for the people that work on this project day to day.
03:14:29 [W1] It would be impossible to talk about what we did for the year without talking about the 2020 of it all now our response initially to to covid to dealing with
03:14:45 [W1] Kind of Shifting for a lot of people Shifting the way they worked Shifting the way they interacted with people and moving towards more virtual content moving towards
03:15:00 [W1] Less meetings when possible being more accommodating about time zones about families. So hat tip to everyone in the project that that really is involved. Sub-project owners Sig chairs and Technical leads committee members, who
03:15:16 [W1] we're incredibly present in conscious about how people are kind of coping with everything that's going on in the world and to that you may be familiar with the kubernative A's
03:15:31 [W1] IO website and we put up a we put up a banner on the website too clearly disclaim that racism is unacceptable race, and it's not something that we
03:15:46 [W1] Tolerate in the project We Believe deeply in our code of conduct and enforcing it to protect the members of of this project.
03:15:55 [W1] So again, hat tip to all of the folks that actually worked on applying the ability to give our website banners steering committee for working with me on the messaging and and
03:16:10 [W1] Delivering that and and holding holding the line.
03:16:13 [W1] I think that you know, it's very it's very easy for statements that can be deemed to be political to attract trolls and we had our fair share of that.
03:16:26 [W1] again hat tip to to everyone involved code of conduct committee steering committee contributor experience for taking on that burden for for feeling.
03:16:39 [W1] Feeling it necessary and important to speak about something.
03:16:44 [W1] that's not a political issue something that is human issue.
03:16:46 [W1] So the chairs and Technical leads we recently spun up.
03:16:53 [W1] It's not recently anymore.
03:16:55 [W1] It's been it's been quite some time now spun up a chair and Technical lead meetings. So giving an opportunity for all of our leadership across the project to sit down chat in in a
03:17:09 [W1] A safe space to exchange ideas without any, you know kind of the the the blameless retrospectives and the and you know having having that safe space to to
03:17:25 [W1] Create ideas that you may not feel comfortable sharing publicly.
03:17:30 [W1] Now. We also started the annual report process.
03:17:34 [W1] So the steering committee kick that off the annual reports essentially starting with the working groups having annual check ins for each of these governance groups giving us an opportunity to get a better feedback loop.
03:17:49 [W1] Between the the the groups that exist in our community and The Wider Community.
03:17:55 [W1] It's very easy to kind of operate in a vacuum. If you are if you don't have you know the chance to to speak about all the accomplishments that you've been doing and also and spread that out
03:18:10 [W1] To the community. So so great great work. They're all of the all the moderators again going back into just handling.
03:18:23 [W1] Handling all of the various of the various properties that we own across Twitter across the the website across discuss.
03:18:32 [W1] hat tip to everyone YouTube Zoom for making everything that we do safe to do and and welcoming.
03:18:45 [W1] Now speaking of Twitter that at the Kate's contributors Twitter handle, which is handled by by contributor experience and the the marketing sub-project of contribute experience.
03:18:59 [W1] So very awesome to see us being able to publish updates about the community more frequently to wider The Wider internet now the the triage kept which poddisruptionbudgets
03:19:14 [W1] Top now we have, you know made a lot of improvements in how we kind of decrease the burden for you to maintain your areas. Right? And I think
03:19:30 [W1] Part of it is was introducing this triage kept something that we discussed for quite some time to get some of the finer details worked out and apply the automation to to the process.
03:19:41 [W1] So hat tip to everyone that was involved there across contributor experience as well as as well as the the enhancements sub-teams and sub-project of sagarika texture.
03:19:56 [W1] The Ingress the Ingress enhancement went g a super exciting long-standing enhancement that has been has been in beta and and it is one of
03:20:11 [W1] Earlier enhancements so great to see the work around delivering that to General availability from the GitHub management side the GitHub Administration Management
03:20:26 [W1] Team has been hard at work deprecating the the kubernetes incubator org, all of the projects that are involved in that org. Some of them that may have been made no longer be maintained
03:20:41 [W1] We built something bigger and better and it lives somewhere else now, so kind of wrangling all of that information and kind of bringing us to the the sunset of the the incubator org.
03:20:55 [W1] now
03:20:57 [W1] first some Sig specific updates we have Sig usability.
03:21:02 [W1] So usability has been driving a user research study that has been that has gotten some really great data to Crunch on and that will be part of their Sig updates during the conference.
03:21:17 [W1] So hat tip to them for one forming over the last year as well as all of the work that they've done to better understand the people who consume kubernative.
03:21:27 [W1] He stated a from Sig multi cluster. The multi cluster service apis are in progress.
03:21:36 [W1] They're currently Alpha. They represent Some solid progress towards normalizing multi cluster deployments and making the next level of kubernative operations more manageable.
03:21:46 [W1] And that's definitely you know, that's definitely something that we consider with, you know, having all of these disparity environments. So how to say
03:21:57 [W1] Multi cluster from the storage side. The container object storage interface was released for both block and file Kate storage being able to build a similar interface for
03:22:12 [W1] for object storage is also coming PSC is
03:23:19 [W1] In down for that so we should see that soon generic ephemeral volumes. We're progressed across the last few Cycles CSI support for Windows, which is huge huge step forward for
03:23:34 [W1] Windows support on kubernative overall the volume snapshot feature is also progressed.
03:23:41 [W1] And yeah, so, you know moving into moving into Sig docks Sig Doc's did an awesome job on the website migration more modern theme easier to
03:23:56 [W1] 18 for their contributors and on the architecture side the production Readiness sub-project as well as the pr R reviews as part of kept our now making their way into the release cycle from the Sig
03:24:11 [W1] Side we've been working on tooling to make our lives easier to make your lives easier to make it easier to release kubernative overall to make it safer.
03:24:21 [W1] It's released kubernative.
03:24:22 [W1] So well as the working group Kate's infra who's been hard at work one.
03:24:27 [W1] You'll hear more about the G the Kate stop cri-o cut over from Google infrastructure to community infrastructure during the conference.
03:24:35 [W1] You'll hear more about the image promotion process how we're handling artifacts moving forward as we now
03:24:41 [W1] now own those artifacts and Community infrastructure.
03:24:45 [W1] And then finally the working group naming was formed right this this kind of ties back into the thought of making sure that this project is is inclusive and being being
03:25:00 [W1] Awful about the language that we use across both our code bases and our an R & R content overall.
03:25:09 [W1] So stay tuned for more details on that later in the conference and a as well as a community meeting from a new initiative that's happening on kind of The Wider Community across LF cncf
03:25:24 [W1] I have standards bodies different companies. So stay tuned for that. Thanks everyone later.
03:25:42 [W1] Thank you Stephen for sharing.
03:25:43 [W1] It is only part of it.
03:25:48 [W1] So thank you to all of our keynote speakers for kicking off the first set of key notes.
03:25:55 [W1] We have a few house each house house eating housekeeping items before we break first and foremost.
03:26:04 [W1] Don't forget to take care of yourself. We understand that the event can be overwhelming and have
03:26:09 [W1] They keep Cloud native. Well initiative virtually this includes chair stretching chair yoga meditation and even puppy and kitten cams. So get out your get out your little family.
03:26:23 [W1] Yes information for all of this can be found in the platform within the experiences suction and Constance. You want to talk more about experiences.
03:26:34 [W1] Yeah. So some of the experiences you can find information about virtual trivia and Escape rooms.
03:26:39 [W1] Virtual escape room sounds like a lot of fun. So you do need to sign up for these so definitely go to that part.
03:26:47 [W1] so next to the experience is tab, you'll see game on which is which it has all the information you need to participate in the virtual games to earn Badges and various prizes also and so after each session attend
03:27:02 [W1] I won't read it ha.
03:27:04 [W1] Oh, sorry.
03:27:05 [W1] Let me start that over again after each session you attend today.
03:27:09 [W1] We would appreciate you leaving any feedback on sketch.com which can be found on the session schedule page and lastly.
03:27:18 [W1] There are few folks that we need to thank because without them none of this would be possible.
03:27:24 [W1] So our Diamond sponsors are Platinum sponsors and gold sponsors as well as the Diversity Scholarship sponsors, please
03:27:32 [W1] Take the time to visit the sponsors in their virtual booths throughout the event and last but not least.
03:27:39 [W1] Thank you to our incredible incredible program committee and the track chairs that work tirelessly on helping us select the sessions for this event.
03:27:49 [W1] Yes.
03:27:50 [W1] Thank you so much that definitely made our process so much easier, and thank you everyone for joining us today.
03:27:57 [W1] Thank you also for your patience, please now join the keynote speakers within the keynote slack Channel.
03:28:02 [W1] On the cloudevents lack workspace for next 50 minutes ask any questions. You may have and breakout sessions begin again today at 3 p.m. Eastern. Thank you everyone and see you tomorrow.
03:28:14 [W1] Have fun.
03:28:22 [W1] Our job is to make kubernative easier and easier and easier to use either from an Ops point of view or developer point of view while acknowledging it is complex because we're solving a complex problem.
03:29:32 [W1] Kubernative will be boring as soon as we can make it boring.
03:29:35 [W1] Maybe after I retire it's already boring.
03:29:39 [W1] So I think we're well on our journey towards kubernative being boring.
03:29:43 [W1] It'll only be boring when it's done.
03:29:45 [W1] It'll only be done when it's no longer relevant.
03:33:24 [W1] our job is to make kubernative easier and easier and easier to use either from an Ops point of view or developer point of view while acknowledging it is complex because
03:33:33 [W1] solving a complex problem
03:34:34 [W1] Kubernative will be boring as soon as we can make it boring.
03:34:37 [W1] Maybe after I retire it's already boring.
03:34:40 [W1] So I think we're well on our journey towards kubernative being boring.
03:34:44 [W1] It'll only be boring when it's done.
03:34:46 [W1] It'll only be done when it's no longer relevant.
