00:00:00 [W] For making this pancake breakfast possible from Cube. Con Boston the North America show. We are all here.
00:00:11 [W] We are ready to go Lynn's got her syrup.
00:00:14 [W] I've got my pancakes.
00:00:18 [W] Joe has his Mountain Dew from the West Virginia Bureau of the new stack.
00:00:24 [W] And look at that.
00:00:25 [W] Everyone has their pancakes.
00:00:28 [W] This is terrific.
00:00:28 [W] So excited for our breakfast this morning.
00:00:32 [W] I want to thank everyone for making this possible.
00:00:37 [W] I'm going to have a quick pan cake before we get started.
00:00:40 [W] Let me see here.
00:00:42 [W] Hmm.
00:00:44 [W] Let me just take a little bite.
00:00:46 [W] Hey Lynn, could you pass the syrup, please?
00:00:51 [W] Yes, did you hi thank you very much for the syrup there. We always say in pancake Land There is a little bit of a particle physics going on.
00:01:07 [W] How about you or what do you have there?
00:01:13 [W] What it what are the whoo-hoo-hoo whatwhat's your pancake special there.
00:01:18 [W] Jeremy would like on but it's a very tasty almost Savory pancake still just a tiny bit sweet pretty awesome.
00:01:25 [W] Yeah, I'm yeah, I'm and Joe what have you got?
00:01:35 [W] What do you got job there?
00:01:40 [W] Oh, I'm just sticking with the mountain. Do I go straight to the Mountain Dew in the morning first thing good deal. Good deal.
00:01:53 [W] Good deal so good.
00:01:54 [W] So let's get started with our breakfast. We have our I'm going to take a quick bite before we get going though.
00:02:00 [W] Just because you know, let's just it's for good one, you know for everyone out there.
00:02:04 [W] I hope people out and pancake Lander. No, that's delicious.
00:02:10 [W] Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.
00:02:12 [W] Hmm.
00:02:13 [W] So our topic for today is about identity and access management when I am.
00:02:22 [W] Hurts, we're easing the pain with pancakes.
00:02:25 [W] We have Nathaniel Quest from Palo Alto networks job from the new stack Lynn son from the SEO team, but IBM, so thank you so much for your participation here.
00:02:40 [W] Started, you know think looking at the context for the world that we're in right now and we're facing more complexities than we ever have before developers have so many choices, especially the ones who are working on
00:02:52 [W] picture
00:02:42 [W] and they're trying to think about all these different configurations all this different interoperability.
00:02:47 [W] The amount of code that people are producing is is considerable the dependencies the vulnerabilities that we see starting to surface are significant as the tax services grow and they become more widespread so
00:03:02 [W] Matter code developer righteous so much more than five or ten years ago.
00:03:03 [W] I'm wondering about your own coverage from denim, you know and how you think about apis and dependencies.
00:03:11 [W] You know, where does that leave leave identity and access management?
00:03:14 [W] I mean from your dream from your perspective and covering the space for so long.
00:03:20 [W] well
00:03:23 [W] He said that every problem with Linux is at its heart a permissions problem.
00:03:31 [W] And and that's what we're talking about here.
00:03:34 [W] Originally, you look developers never thought about that's a gross generalization, but it's all about the users of well the rights of the users who are using their applications
00:03:49 [W] Schmidt is at heart it's not exactly a security thing either. It's not a developer problem, or was it a developer problem?
00:03:51 [W] It wasn't a security problem.
00:03:52 [W] It really almost was a network problem.
00:03:54 [W] If a certain individual or certain process of wants to access another process or resource over line over aligned and then you have to have the permissions and place to meet
00:04:09 [W] Another process or resource over line over aligned and then you have to have the permissions and place to meet all the policy requirements about who can ask not ask ask.
00:04:18 [W] Requirements about who can ask not ask ask for these particular resources and this is entirely new problem. I will distributed computing on the on a massive and widespread scale.
00:04:33 [W] Leading problem.
00:04:33 [W] They're good Solutions out there.
00:04:34 [W] I'm sure we'll get into Opa pretty shortly. But it's almost a mindset of number one who can figure out what to do and then how to go about doing it.
00:04:46 [W] It's it's totally new issue or relatively news you anyway.
00:04:53 [W] Yeah.
00:04:54 [W] Okay.
00:04:54 [W] great.
00:04:55 [W] I just want to remind everyone out there who's watching the breakfast that you can ask questions at any time the platform allows for that.
00:05:04 [W] So, please ask your questions.
00:05:06 [W] We'd love to hear what you're thinking is here.
00:05:09 [W] We did this when we're in person where we base a lot of the discussion on the questions that people have I want to turn though next to Nathaniel.
00:05:19 [W] And get an idea about this complexity and thinking about the actors who are attacking and what are they targeting?
00:05:28 [W] Who are they targeting?
00:05:29 [W] Are they taking advantage of things to make their attacks?
00:05:35 [W] What's the connection between config management and identity for instance in kubernative?
00:05:41 [W] Yeah, most certainly.
00:05:42 [W] Um, it's a great kind of topic.
00:05:45 [W] So with in Palo Alto we do a cloud threat report.
00:05:49 [W] We usually release it every six months.
00:05:51 [W] far as how identity is misconfigured or how its scaled across multiple environments as organizations build into the cloud, they start building environment and that environment, you know, by using things like infrastructure as code
00:06:05 [W] The of that nature can scale really quickly dynamically and that just adds more complexity on top and top of top of every single layer with every new environment that an organization builds if there is a Miss configuration
00:06:14 [W] Um, you know resource or something of that nature it can scale across a lot of different organizations. We have found that there are
00:06:28 [W] Cloud environment, we found the 23 percent of organizations are experiencing some sore some form of crypto mining operation with their environment within their environment and within those particular groups that are targeting that so the actual
00:06:43 [W] Are performing the crypto jacking in those Cloud environment?
00:06:45 [W] They are specifically targeting those, you know, cloud service provider credentials the you know, if you will the AWS access ID and the secret keys that are stored on each one of those particular Cloud endpoints.
00:06:59 [W] So anything that is scalable or if those particular IEDs those credentials are actually put into those Cloud endpoints, you know, if an attacker was able to
00:07:11 [W] To compromise that particular system then they would have access to those credentials that were stored on that on that end point.
00:07:19 [W] And then with it just being template templatized just makes it a whole lot easier for them to not just gain access to the system, but then, you know take a step farther and gain access to the actual environment itself. You know, that is a thing
00:07:34 [W] happening
00:07:36 [W] Well linbit.
00:08:02 [W] Yeah, so before I get to servicemeshcon to take a second from my perspective on how this is not so easy with Cuban at ease.
00:08:12 [W] So as we all know developers are moving their applications to Cuba Nettie's they are looking at microservices as the architecture.
00:08:22 [W] So Cuban daddy provide service account as identity for services and you could
00:08:32 [W] Use like the default servicer can come with your namespace or optionally you can use specific service account within a namespace but these service accounts. They are not really the identity for the
00:08:47 [W] Yeah, so before I get to servicemeshcon to take a second from my perspective on how this is not so easy with Cuban at ease.
00:08:49 [W] So as we all know developers are moving their applications to Cuban at ease. They are looking at microservices as the architecture.
00:08:59 [W] So Cuban daddy provide service account as identity for services and you could
00:09:09 [W] Use like the default service account come with your namespace or optionally you can use specific service account within a namespace but these service accounts. They are not really the identity for the user.
00:10:35 [W] They're really the identities associated with the service and the parts that's backing off the service to the while you can assign like the cluster or
00:10:50 [W] In to allow you to have access allow your service to have access to Cuban ID resources and apis so these are not serviced Centric.
00:11:01 [W] It's really hard for a user a service owner who develop services and Rhonda services on Cuban ID to say, you know what I want to control who has access to
00:11:16 [W] It is and I want to config.
00:11:17 [W] What are the services?
00:11:19 [W] I'm allowed to access and I don't really just want to control that simply at the service level because I would maybe also want to have even more
00:11:34 [W] I want I would only want to allow this particular service to access me.
00:11:34 [W] Maybe only an /hello as a past.
00:11:38 [W] Maybe they can only do get operation.
00:11:41 [W] They can't really do post operation.
00:11:44 [W] So these are some of the challenges we're trying to solve and provide.
00:11:50 [W] It's so much easier experience for user on servicemeshcon.
00:11:58 [W] Authentication and authorization policies that's more service-oriented and they can leverage layer 7 data to make Intelligent Decisions on that.
00:12:11 [W] Layer 7 data to make Intelligent Decisions and how is that in context in comparison to traditional practices people have used. This is a real shift, isn't it?
00:12:26 [W] Definitely a real shift.
00:12:28 [W] Yeah. So if you look at Cuban at ease without servicemeshcon mean Cuban at he has like service account we talk about right typically people use our Network policies to kind of
00:12:43 [W] How to access and most recently I believe with network policy you can specify Parts selector so you could potentially say this network policy is from this particular part with this selector.
00:12:55 [W] This network policy is from this particular part with this selector to the particular destination.
00:12:49 [W] However, there are some limitations with network policy.
00:12:53 [W] First of all, it's not TLS base 2. So the traffic is not necessary secure and now we'll policy typically is more environmental specific.
00:13:07 [W] That's more tight. You like your IP.
00:13:09 [W] You're not work. So asking you
00:13:11 [W] your services are moved from one Community to the other community to rewrite of the push and work policy. These challenges are attending the immolated in the world of servicemeshcon.
00:13:39 [W] Joe I think there's a little background noise to me.
00:13:44 [W] Go ahead Jo.
00:13:45 [W] Oh, yeah.
00:13:46 [W] .
00:13:54 [W] About this or is it more this all fall on the kubernative operations.
00:14:04 [W] Is Joe I think there's a little background noise from?
00:14:11 [W] Go ahead Jo.
00:14:12 [W] Oh, yeah.
00:14:14 [W] Yeah.
00:14:22 [W] About this or is it more this all fall on the kubernative operations group?
00:14:29 [W] So honestly for me, you know application developer have so much to worry about I mean because they are focus is more business najuk right? Make sure they are Services functional
00:15:07 [W] Needs to be like a Elevate you to the platform owner who owns like the architecture and the platform of of Cuban at ease to handle that and the other advantage to handle this
00:15:22 [W] That way is you get consistency, right? So you got Polly see consistency among different Services instead of leave you delegate that to your service owner.
00:15:34 [W] it's only a maid handle different than service on the be, you know, you could get very inconsistent results that may not match your corporate to our policy.
00:15:48 [W] Yeah, we do have a question here.
00:15:50 [W] Oh, go ahead Q.
00:15:54 [W] No, I mean it's perfect.
00:15:55 [W] Thank you for giving me the time neck. I'm Lynn.
00:15:58 [W] I totally agree and I think from we did some research on, you know, kubernative llamo files that we were able to scrape from the internet. We looked at about 200 almost 250,000 llamo files to look at for configuration
00:16:13 [W] There's actually doing in their environment and we found that one of the most common misconfigurations that we found within these particular instances.
00:16:21 [W] And I think this has to do with the complexity that you're talking about, you know is that we found that that organizations or at least the the developers of several a lot of these llamo files were actually just running their containers under a
00:16:36 [W] I think that's probably simply because it's that's just the fastest way to get it done.
00:16:32 [W] I mean with the you know, the Advent not even the Advent just the the time frame that that most developers need to work within our environment is you know, I mean do they have time to build a secure operation do they do they have the understanding of the
00:16:47 [W] Each base of all those systems to actually put together a secure container cluster or is it just I need to get this done out and you get this out and out the door. We'll worry about security later and we'll just push it out the door, you know,
00:16:59 [W] The complexity is adding to the insecurity of kubernative, or do you think that we can make like kubernative clusters, you know, like building a cluster with a proper meshmark easily easily accessable, bye-bye.
00:17:12 [W] assets
00:17:12 [W] Yeah, I really think that's the goal of the industry.
00:17:16 [W] I has all over. All right, we want build the right skeleton. I would say for the infrastructure for application developers that has the right security policies in place and then the platform owner
00:17:31 [W] Application developers that has the right security policies in place and then the platform owner or the operator. If you wish to call who can control that security policy based on their corporate
00:17:43 [W] Create a policy based on their corporate requirement and they are customer requirements and they each service owner.
00:17:51 [W] I would think it's just filling in you know, they are services in there and then they are Services would be fitting into the big picture of compliance and security and honestly my goal is
00:18:06 [W] the owner should be really minimum and I would maybe expect them to like propagate security headers, right like JW headers, you know, they got to propagate that so we can continue leverage
00:18:21 [W] Past but I think the industry is trending towards like zero trust security.
00:18:23 [W] Well, each of the requests are secured.
00:18:27 [W] not only an secure naming but also our encryption Mutual TRS and also the authorization on top of all that
00:18:39 [W] we have a good one.
00:18:43 [W] Yeah, well, we have a question and I'd love to get to it and just for everyone who's out there.
00:18:49 [W] Thank you for joining us and we would love to hear your questions. We do this in person when we have when we did have that opportunity before a pancake breakfast.
00:18:59 [W] So, please feel free to ask anything you like.
00:19:02 [W] I want to get to the first question from Jeffrey Bradley who says in the old days we would host our secure portions behind a DMZ then have a small.
00:19:13 [W] Portia open to the public. I know Kate seems to allow a similar ability with defining the Ingress control with kubernetes.
00:19:22 [W] Have we quit isolating operations the Faneuil?
00:19:31 [W] you know, I mean, this is It's a good it's a good look because you know, I know the the the, you know crusty, you know exterior that DMZ hard shell and then the soft gooey interior of the you know
00:19:46 [W] additional network is kind of gone away, especially with you know, kubernative, you know being going, you know, you know at focused, you know, and you know, making that the interface between, you know end users and the actual Services they use making
00:19:59 [W] In the end users and the actual Services they use making that that boundary that edge barrier so much more, you know, it's thinner we have to say that to say it easily, you know and isolating your application isolating our
00:19:58 [W] To say that to say it easily, you know and isolating your application isolating our containers to just that one application being exposed to those particular end users with the you know, the databases laying behind it.
00:20:11 [W] They should be you know protected or isolated from inside of that.
00:20:16 [W] You know, I guess you could call it a mini DMZ within a cluster.
00:20:19 [W] I think that it's really important to do that within the containers that we've seen or we'll lose that we've researched.
00:20:27 [W] Searched, you know that there are certainly attempts to make that happen. But we still find a lot of organizations that are still just you know, exposing or running services with root access, which is just, you know, don't do that, but
00:20:43 [W] But that's common still and I think that just there's complexity.
00:20:45 [W] I would like to hear Lin's idea on this with you know, the, you know, are we isolating processes or are we isolating the containers or is it just you know, I'd like to hear you know what you think.
00:21:01 [W] Yeah, so I think we are going to continue the trend to secure the edge. In fact, if you look at servicemeshcon Piccoli right now, not only with secure the edge
00:21:16 [W] The traffic coming in as we also secured the outgoing Edge, right?
00:21:18 [W] So that's what kubernative doesn't really do right now.
00:21:21 [W] So not only you control precisely.
00:21:24 [W] What are the traffic coming but also you don't really trust anything that's already in your network, even though you know, the services might be within the V PC or private now, could you just don't trust it's like
00:21:39 [W] Still want you to validate the identity. Like we were mentioning you want to validate the key and search make sure you know, they can be really Mutual our trusted and then as your services needs to go out
00:21:49 [W] Mutual our trusted and then as your services needs to go out to the cluster may be consumed some Services IBM Cloud.
00:21:57 [W] Oh, maybe Google Cloud you want to kind of secure the outbound traffic as well and it's highly recommended for you so that your platform owner can set up a policy on to you.
00:22:09 [W] Hey, these are the services We Trust as external service.
00:22:14 [W] Isis and these are the only Services you can work with as service owner wasting on the particular Cuban and environment.
00:22:24 [W] I'm so glad that you mentioned and you talked about, you know, restricting outbound access to Services because I mean we see, you know, eighty to ninety percent of organizations.
00:22:34 [W] Don't even touch their outbound egress.
00:22:36 [W] They only address their inbound, you know, you know Network traffic and for restrictions, so so thank you for mentioned that it's important to know what your service is should be talking to in limiting them to only those specific Lanes. I think that's very important for containers. Is
00:22:51 [W] Talked about you know, restricting outbound access to Services because I mean we see, you know, eighty to ninety percent of organizations. Don't even touch their outbound egress.
00:23:00 [W] They only address their inbound, you know, you know Network traffic for restrictions. So so thank you for mentioning that it's important to know what your service is should be talking to in limiting them to only those specific Lanes. I think that's very important for containers. Is
00:23:31 [W] Location and that's the only thing you should be doing it should be doing nothing else.
00:23:35 [W] Other than that that one service that it's that it's providing.
00:23:38 [W] This should be the same for Network traffic as well.
00:23:40 [W] So, yeah. Thank you.
00:23:42 [W] I have some questions.
00:23:44 [W] Go ahead.
00:23:46 [W] Linbit.
00:23:46 [W] Go ahead.
00:23:47 [W] I was just going to emphasize the importance of the album. And in fact a good practices. If you can't of around like your outbound egress Gateway and daddy Katie knows and then you can make sure all the traffic from your meshmark.
00:24:03 [W] If needs to go outbound only goes through the egress Gateway first and then reach out to the outbound so that you have kind of a double security on that, too.
00:24:15 [W] Well, then I would do want to add here again that there's actually an opportunity to win a spatula you could get a spatula if you ask a question. So
00:24:30 [W] You learn you gotta flip those pancakes somehow flip them.
00:24:26 [W] So we have a another question from Deepak V shevin Deepak asks, he actually has two questions.
00:24:35 [W] And so why don't we go for the first one?
00:24:37 [W] I'm about identity standpoint C says form identity standpoint servicemeshcon at the service level.
00:24:45 [W] How does it tie back to the user identity level for instance, you know in these identity management environment and it this is a question.
00:24:55 [W] I have to about the varying types of identity management systems out there for kubernative. There really is no standard and what happens if you're you know, pulling in identity, you know pulling
00:25:10 [W] I mean the information from external sources that might be from a virtualized environment for instance.
00:25:12 [W] not actually be part of the kubernative not might may not be a kubernative artifact at all.
00:25:24 [W] Do you want me to take that I like her and want to go for?
00:25:28 [W] Okay, so so far most servicemeshcon spective specifically for sto. We have authentication policies, right?
00:25:37 [W] So inside of authentication policies, there are two types one is request authentication, which is also called and user authentication the second type is pure.
00:25:53 [W] Syndication policies right? So inside of authentication policies, there are two types one is request authentication, which is also called and user authentication
00:26:08 [W] Authentication, which is typically referring to Mutual tikv used for service to service authentication like you were saying, so let me focus on the request authentication. So request authentication
00:26:24 [W] For end user authentication to Valley to verify the credentials attached to the request.
00:26:31 [W] So for instance is 3 OK in users can interact with is still by enabling like request level authentication with ja token and then it still can help.
00:26:46 [W] Date when the requests coming if the request has like a bell token it still can Ingress Gateway of is still can validate their bowel token along with the jot.
00:26:59 [W] Lead eight doubt about token along with the jot credential to see you know, it does the user have the right credentials.
00:27:06 [W] So so that's how you can of be able to kind of tie the external identity management level into into a servicemeshcon the HTML when the traffic comes in
00:27:21 [W] into a servicemeshcon here when the traffic comes in and then as and then optionally if you choose you could potentially propagate that request that has the
00:27:36 [W] Nation throughout your microservices so that it's you can double-check as part of the Harbour Cruise it can check, you know only if it's this principle the traffic can be allowed.
00:27:54 [W] Anything you'd like to add to that the Faneuil?
00:27:58 [W] No, I think covered it very well for sure.
00:28:02 [W] identity is such a important aspect of endpoint security especially in cloudevents and just you know, having sto being able to double check Ur, you know each one of those connections Services people who are connecting to it.
00:28:17 [W] Full so so great so job. I wanted to ask you about the general tone from the conference on topics related to security.
00:28:24 [W] I know spiffe e spires been getting some attention what topics occur, you know in kind of a from a security perspective overall.
00:28:32 [W] we seeing emerge at the conference that this week?
00:28:42 [W] You're on me addressing this particular problem.
00:29:12 [W] We have some other things happening.
00:29:13 [W] I've brno a open source of coordinated policy engine. This comes from Nevada has also joined the cncf and this will help bridge bridgecrew
00:29:29 [W] To the developers into the platform are developers by providing a set of knative tools.
00:29:30 [W] There's also the certainty that your project that comes I think from jet stream.
00:29:37 [W] That was the difficuit management controller and start your Ollie's a headache to get up and running but this allows you to issue certificates from let's encrypt hashicorp Vault and others. So
00:29:53 [W] You know security is growing issue.
00:29:48 [W] I'm looking forward to Ian cold Waters talk today during the keynote and she's going to delve into that more.
00:29:57 [W] I just advise if you ask me about Security in machine learning and this is a totally new field looking looking forward to more into
00:30:12 [W] but basically you can or an attacker you say and get I guess a rough description of how a particular model works is by querying it, you know a few hundred times
00:30:26 [W] Or image recognition.
00:30:22 [W] He had a great example privilege recognition and also for this speech recognition as well.
00:30:29 [W] And the idea is instead of spending millions of dollars to build out models.
00:30:35 [W] You can't just take a model that's exposed to the public internet or that you have access to query and come up with a rough approximation pretty quickly. So yeah, there's definitely a lot
00:30:48 [W] talk about security as kubernative moves away from the prototypes and the Skunk Works and moves into actual production security becomes a huge issue good stuff
00:31:03 [W] It's stuff down it Nathaniel.
00:31:03 [W] There is a question here from Ethan Kleiner. Anythin ass good question for Nathaniel given the space of work.
00:31:12 [W] He's in now.
00:31:12 [W] What's the most common? No? No that's been seen for maintaining Security in kubernative privileged containers something else you'd like to know so you can be sure to avoid it. Thank youi think liner.
00:31:29 [W] Yeah, most certainly. I think the biggest issues right now would surrounding kubernative just out as we see is across the industry is again, I've mentioned it a couple times already but not running your containers with the
00:31:44 [W] Limiting the services that are allowed to Surf, you know, the service connections allow to particular applications to particular containers making sure that those are not route.
00:31:51 [W] that would be helpful and then you know using if there's a way to validate those users that are actually pushing code the services that are pushing code whether using Jenkins or some sort of ci/cd pipeline to you know, push those systems up
00:32:06 [W] You know essentially we're trying to control the identity who has access to those systems live, you know least privileges, you know, reducing the amount of rights that that particular container has to only a specifically what it's supposed to be using.
00:32:14 [W] And there was a third one.
00:32:13 [W] Oh and vulnerabilities making sure that the the applications themselves are in the latest patch their latest release.
00:32:19 [W] So continually scanning your container environment for vulnerabilities misconfigurations using some sort of infrastructure as code, you know scanner, you know, there are a couple that that are out there for sure.
00:32:34 [W] Source ones empowerus so has one within its prison MacLeod toolset.
00:32:37 [W] So, you know scan your system to make sure that the vulnerabilities are taking care of make sure there's not any misconfigurations make sure that they're not running under privileged accounts, you know, and then limit what actions and rights they are allowed to do
00:32:52 [W] Two counts, you know and then limit what actions and rights they are allowed to do they shouldn't be doing anything other than what that one specific job. They're supposed to be doing.
00:33:01 [W] Excellent.
00:33:02 [W] You still have a chance to win a spatula?
00:33:07 [W] Yeah, spatula spatula.
00:33:10 [W] I'll stop talking about specialist.
00:33:13 [W] So Lynn. I have a question for you. And one question came in.
00:33:19 [W] I think really quickly.
00:33:20 [W] How does is co differ from liquidy and that came from the onto Das there was another question too.
00:33:26 [W] And how did the HPI management tools like a pudgy work with the sto servicemeshcon to how does the identity workloads?
00:33:37 [W] for the proxy and point in East-West connections
00:33:49 [W] Wow, three questions for me.
00:33:51 [W] Okay, great. So I would be I could be biased and I'm being asked is Tod first from be so I will try to be very neutral the biggest difference.
00:34:04 [W] I would say I into foes if you ask me first, it's a proxy use, right we both saw servicemeshcon you so it still use Envoy if you read the cncf reports.
00:34:18 [W] You two have a lot of momentum as a real popular proxy so lengthy using their own proxy written in Rust so that would be the number one difference. Number two difference that I would say
00:34:34 [W] Iran just so that would be the number one difference.
00:34:32 [W] Number two difference that I would say is the community behind is still well. It still is a five-year project when it still was incubated at IBM and
00:34:47 [W] Is a five year project to when it still was incubated at IBM and Google before it's still even exist.
00:34:56 [W] So that's like one year work plus if there is about four years old now, so there's 300 company and 400-plus contributor are backing is co-project. So when you evaluate
00:35:11 [W] 300 company and 400-plus contributor are backing sto projects.
00:35:16 [W] So when you evaluate our open source project, I think a key criteria.
00:35:22 [W] I personally look at is you know how diverse the contributors are what are the key companies backing of the projects? Because I think these are super important perspective.
00:35:35 [W] So, please maybe Google a little bit more on this topic.
00:35:40 [W] I think there's plenty of information but these are the two I can highlight.
00:35:46 [W] Okay, it is far as yeah.
00:35:50 [W] Yeah guy be API management. Yeah, the it how it works of this deal for instant.
00:35:57 [W] Yeah, so I would say API management to compliment to a servicemeshcon Castillo.
00:36:04 [W] I remember in very early days of is still we actually had API management.
00:36:12 [W] what group and we were trying to kind of fold some of the API management functionality into is still but then we realize it's more important for servicemeshcon.
00:36:27 [W] To be simple and focus on the key scenarios we want to solve which is connect secure and observe.
00:36:37 [W] Like is still and we can end up with this sample that work group as the result of that.
00:36:43 [W] However, I mean API management continue have a play in this space, right because people still wants to get like they are pricing and data usage of the API.
00:36:56 [W] That's when you can potentially use API Management in conjunction with servicemeshcon.
00:37:07 [W] Yeah, and I want to ask Lynn a question specifically on API as far as within SEO as a researcher.
00:37:16 [W] I like to poke around in things and see what what what other information I can possibly get out of a particular tool and I looked at this deal for a while and and unfortunately a time constraints and I had go to a different aspect one of the things I was looking at was the API
00:37:31 [W] Before poor sto and I'm curious, you know, is there like an API monitor, you know a querying monitor system that will limit things are temps of fuzzing.
00:37:43 [W] Is there a security product within sto or security feature that like limits the amount of apis or you know, the fuzzing capability of somebody doing something malicious to and is steel mesh.
00:37:57 [W] Yeah, so you could potentially still by itself.
00:38:01 [W] It's extensible, right?
00:38:03 [W] So we actually reacted hectare of extensibility.
00:38:07 [W] So it used to be a component called mixer where you can as a user or a provider you can write plugin for mixer. For example Opa has a mixer adapter. So that's how they extend
00:38:22 [W] Who is Opa so the when the request comes in to microservices it can check with Opa to see hey is this request aloud now? We are on to the trend instead.
00:38:29 [W] They just went out yesterday and we actually removed the mixture components. The reason is Envoy the wiser module of envoy has been the new industry Trend
00:38:29 [W] Allow users to do customizations for that psycho haproxy, so you could potentially write into Envoy either using Envoy filter or user using
00:38:43 [W] A to make a great name it you we do have a test case to have like for instance for really meeting Envoy filter that allows to control the rate for a particular service.
00:38:50 [W] Thank you.
00:38:52 [W] That's awesome news awesome information.
00:38:54 [W] Yeah, Joe. Yeah, let's address that.
00:39:06 [W] Yeah, so the question is the how that's the identity works for the proxy and points in east and west connections.
00:39:16 [W] So it's you uses like secure and naming for each of the services. So as the service as the Pod for the surfaces to get put
00:39:31 [W] The smash so the psi-cop proxy wood wood base are the secrets for the service account for that particular service along with like the root certificate
00:39:43 [W] For the service account for that particular service along with like the root certificate to get to issue a certificate signing request with its your control play.
00:39:49 [W] So as part of the signing request it would get like keys and certs related for that service.
00:39:57 [W] So when the traffic are established between service a to service be for to services within the mash basically the cycle proxy would
00:40:06 [W] good trap all the incoming traffic as the traffic goes out from podesta to Part B. So the cycle proxy would check is withstand the
00:40:22 [W] Stu to Poppy on the B-side the psycho proxy is going to trap the incoming traffic and it's going to check is the does that say have the right identity?
00:40:33 [W] that's a have the right certificate and that is a even allowed to talk to be. Is there any other back rules in place? If all the things are checked to be successful then
00:40:48 [W] See the service P side would forward the traffic to the beep the big container that service be owner road.
00:40:58 [W] So that's how the traffic kind of works for identity. So basically we use maturity as the key answers and also secure naming to make sure the traffic can be allowed.
00:41:13 [W] All right.
00:41:14 [W] Well a little more housekeeping. So we're looking we're really appreciating all the questions coming in.
00:41:20 [W] So keep bringing them.
00:41:21 [W] So keeping it keeping the questions.
00:41:23 [W] So, how do you get a spatula? Well, you can direct message us on Twitter at the new stack or you can email Colleen at the new stack dot IO or you can even go to our booth at Cube
00:41:38 [W] Enter to get the link to the form to the farm for the for the spatula award. So to speak Jobe any questions that you'd like to ask that you're seeing from the audience.
00:41:54 [W] Yeah, the questions are pretty specific.
00:42:16 [W] I'm sorry open policy agent.
00:42:18 [W] I guess I would like to ask the presenters.
00:42:22 [W] I mean are they seeing a way of handling policies with kubernative or are there are there concerns about Opa or what's happening out there?
00:42:46 [W] I guess I'll take off the this little section first.
00:42:49 [W] I mean from my aspect. I have not seen anything. Like I haven't seen Opa being directly targeted by anything.
00:42:54 [W] So I can't really comment on to its further functionality outside of that.
00:43:00 [W] I certainly very popular.
00:42:53 [W] I know in all the ways of is he out? There are people from the community challenging is you know, why are you using to be people identity?
00:43:05 [W] Why are we not using?
00:43:07 [W] so the result of that discussion landed on the mixer adopter for all right, so we want to prove to the community not
00:43:21 [W] Support the default one but also you can extend if Opa is your Preferred Choice of operations extend.
00:43:41 [W] Being a little noise there in the background. So I want to ask a question from Joshua Bell and I'm going to direct this one to you. And if annual what are some great tools for discovering issues with my
00:43:56 [W] Like this field the 405.
00:43:51 [W] being a little noise there in the background, so
00:43:56 [W] I want to ask a question from Joshua Bell and I'm going to direct this one to you. And if annual what are some great tools for discovering issues with my I am set up.
00:44:08 [W] Yeah, perfect.
00:44:12 [W] So looking for your for your eyes, you know, identity and access management.
00:44:17 [W] I'm looking for tools that can scan those or at least look look at your configuration if you're looking for a like a
00:44:26 [W] Of cloud security platform or CSP.
00:44:30 [W] There are a number of them available.
00:44:32 [W] There are specific tools.
00:44:34 [W] There's a lot of Open Source tools specifically a GitHub.
00:44:37 [W] There's you know, I am Skinner's there are config management templates specifically within prison MacLeod, which is my overarching Palo Alto, you know family that I'm in prison MacLeod as soon as
00:44:52 [W] My overarching Palo Alto, you know family that I'm in prison MacLeod as soon as you bring your Cloud platform into the system.
00:45:02 [W] It is immediately scanning your your I am configurations to look for misconfigurations and thickness things of that nature.
00:45:10 [W] There are other tools, you know, since I am part of prison cloud and pellet. Oh, that's just my first go-to because they pay my bills, but but
00:45:20 [W] There are a number of Open Source tools that are out there to to assist with scanning and we can we can throw together a list of this some point. I don't have anything just right off the top of my head.
00:45:33 [W] Okay, great.
00:45:34 [W] So, why do we get then? Ask the last question from someone who has actually had the chance to ask a question yet.
00:45:44 [W] Let's see here.
00:45:48 [W] We have one from Ricardo.
00:45:49 [W] Actually we went from Ricardo needs asking again about API gateways and he's asking what I miss is be able to see the eighth guy.
00:46:01 [W] Except the microservices running in the mesh says he I believe that it doesn't make sense to have it as we don't have an API Gateway as mentioned, correct?
00:46:13 [W] Does that does that make sense?
00:46:19 [W] He's missing the API contracts of the microservices running in the mash.
00:46:23 [W] Company, does it have an API Gateway as mentioned?
00:46:33 [W] Well, I go on to understand, okay?
00:46:37 [W] I think it's time that I would just need to have a little bit more information.
00:46:41 [W] Okay, let's go on to then one last question because we're going to have to run.
00:46:46 [W] we're right at the end of the time. So, what's the work that you really excited about?
00:46:50 [W] What do you what do you seeing for you as you move forward in this space?
00:46:54 [W] What is it?
00:46:55 [W] That's really getting you excited Lynn.
00:46:59 [W] Yeah, so I would say, you know, I would emphasize security is hard.
00:47:04 [W] It's still we spend a lot of time we moved from microservices to monolithic.
00:47:12 [W] We stopped a mountain. So it's best for kids and serves to the Pod with we did a lot of change in our own control play to make sure it's as secure as it could be so I'm very
00:47:27 [W] Excited, you know in this space as we continue collaborator on the servicemeshcon. Hopefully provide users security policies for the platform owners. That would save the
00:47:42 [W] Service on their Farm worried too much about security identity, you know Access Control.
00:47:49 [W] I'm really hoping you know, we can sue our Technologies like servicemeshcon can Elevate that to a much higher level to the platform owner the variable?
00:48:03 [W] I mean the the cloud is 64% of our internet right now.
00:48:07 [W] It's just getting bigger and bigger and it's getting more prevalent.
00:48:11 [W] So there are so many opportunities.
00:48:13 [W] There are so many things from a researcher to to look at and investigate and try to figure out if it's actually working the securely improperly. So it's just an amazing field to be in way to go.
00:48:26 [W] Nice job everyone.
00:48:28 [W] Thank you for participating in our pancake breakfast. I want to thank Palo Alto networks another spok.
00:48:33 [W] Virtual Round of Applause and I also want to just say after the pancakes here.
00:48:39 [W] You can go enter you can go to the new stack booth and enter our spatula contest sweepstakes to win a Star Wars spatula set.
00:48:52 [W] So May the force be with you made the pancakes be with you.
00:48:58 [W] Maybe we live on and prosper in this new and New Age. Thank you so much.
00:49:03 [W] Much for joining us linbit.
00:49:10 [W] You so much Nathaniel Joe.
00:49:07 [W] We appreciate your participation will be back again soon.
00:49:12 [W] Thanks so much for having us.
