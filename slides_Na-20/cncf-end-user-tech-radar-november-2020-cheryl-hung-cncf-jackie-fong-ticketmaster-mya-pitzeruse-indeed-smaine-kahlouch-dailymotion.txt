00:00:00 [W] Hey everyone, and welcome to this session.
00:00:03 [W] I'm Cheryl hung.
00:00:05 [W] I'm the VP of ecosystem at the cloud native Computing Foundation.
00:00:09 [W] Which I'm really excited by so let's take a look.
00:00:17 [W] Basically, what I do at cncf is I work with end users to get them engaged and active in the ecosystem so that they can successfully adopt Technologies, like kubernative and Prometheus. You can find me a toy show on Twitter.
00:00:34 [W] And these are some of the companies that I work with. So this ranges from startups to large Enterprises all fantastic companies that are using cloud knative and I'm very honored to be joined by three of them here today
00:00:49 [W] Out the cncf end-user technology radar gun, so I would like them to each introduce themselves.
00:00:47 [W] So first of all, we have Jackie Fang, please introduce yourself.
00:00:51 [W] Hey when I'm Jackie Farm, I work at Master took a mess of for the last three years as their engineering manager leading their kubernative platform team and ci/cd team
00:01:06 [W] most recently developer experience and we develop the platform for developers to consume and recently we migrated our self-managed kubenetes to e KS
00:01:15 [W] Migrated our self-managed kubernative Stewie KS at the beginning of 2020 which shows help. I kick-started a servicemeshcon and use a group with cncf as a culture. So I'm happy to be
00:01:26 [W] The coach are so happy to be here.
00:01:29 [W] Great.
00:01:31 [W] Thank you Spain.
00:01:34 [W] I'm sweating and devops team leader at Dell emotion, which is this video distribution platform. Basically pretty famous in France and Europe in this dimension of leading a team, which is in
00:01:49 [W] the cognitive platform is this platform is the hybrid platform mostly on premises and we have some stuff on grab and we are responsible of the whole developer experience
00:02:04 [W] love and we are responsible of the whole developer experience to from the laptop this ci/cd through the how they shape their the application to production and also the
00:02:15 [W] dashing through the production
00:02:17 [W] and also the the organizer of the cncf Ares meet up and SES cncf abandoned asada, and I'm nice to you.
00:02:27 [W] I'm glad to be here to ingest take Maya you're next. Hello everyone.
00:02:36 [W] My name is Maya my pronouns.
00:02:37 [W] Are she and her I'm a former principal engineer who worked on in Deeds compute storage and a bit observability platforms.
00:02:45 [W] recently left in joined a small startup.
00:02:47 [W] The facts I'm happy to be here.
00:02:50 [W] Awesome. I want to say thank you to all three of you for coming together to be the radar team and be the editors for this edition of the techradar.
00:03:02 [W] So just a reminder the tech radar is a way of assessing upcoming Solutions and different Technologies.
00:03:10 [W] So the idea is to pick which tools you would recommend to place in adopt. In other words, they're mature and they're stable.
00:03:19 [W] They've been used by many different teams many different use cases or you can put it in trial which is to say that you know, it's there's some success but may not be applicable in all cases or assess.
00:03:32 [W] He's up and coming or maybe there are other solutions for different use cases.
00:03:37 [W] I want to ask you to the radar to you. Why did you choose database storage for this radar?
00:03:47 [W] I would start by saying that I was wondering how was the adoption in this cncf and user community in this particular area because this cncf communities pretty mature on Humanity's platform and
00:04:02 [W] The evolution of the kubenetes platform, but I wanted to know how databases fits in this In This Cloud native domain.
00:04:11 [W] I know one day indeed side of the world as we started to shift more and more of our workloads to the cloud.
00:04:16 [W] We were really interested in how people were running their databases whether they were choosing the go managed services or running in cluster and what kind of some of the technology decisions that went into that per as well as how they were handling some of their scale out.
00:04:32 [W] Yeah, I'm pretty similar would love to pick the community spring.
00:04:38 [W] We've been migrating out on-prem presents to the cloud on the database front. We have leakage systems running on all go and just looking forward to get some insight from the computer community
00:04:53 [W] Some experiences to migrate out of either Oracle or Iran to Oracle on the cloud. So super excited for this topic.
00:05:00 [W] I'm definitely excited to see the results for this. So just a reminder for how the technology radar is put together.
00:05:09 [W] We created a Google spreadsheet with a list of different tools.
00:05:14 [W] And this was not exhaustive. So people can add their own extra Tools in as well.
00:05:20 [W] And then we asked each company to add a column for themselves and choose whether within their own company. They recommend that
00:05:30 [W] Tools are adopts trial assess or hold. So holding explicitly here doesn't mean we don't use it or we don't have it at all.
00:05:42 [W] Hold means we might have it but we don't recommend that new applications use this technology and then here we've got some of the the companies that have contributed to the
00:05:56 [W] results of this and probably a sort of slight bias towards the medium and larger size companies overall.
00:06:08 [W] All right, here we go ready for the results actually before we do that.
00:06:12 [W] Let's talk about what did you expect?
00:06:13 [W] So what did you think was going to come out from this?
00:06:17 [W] That's right even start.
00:06:10 [W] I kind of expected a lot of people that like continue using the technologies that they were familiar with just because you already have a lot of expertise on it from the engineering side, you know, the rewrite applications good compatibility there.
00:06:26 [W] yeah I expect Oracle like I mentioned earlier to be up there as well and for most of the companies that has entered in the information in there they key most of them said on on ho or
00:06:29 [W] To be on her face towel, so that was surprising but otherwise most of those are putting in line with what we've been using and I was expecting a much more experiments
00:06:41 [W] Knative databases.
00:06:43 [W] This is something that we received later on but I want I want you to see because we worked on the POC that the demotion to identify our next not a base color knative database and I was expecting that
00:06:58 [W] Any will do the same experience?
00:07:01 [W] Okay, so that's quite interesting.
00:07:02 [W] We've got a wide range Farm, you know, we expected Oracle db2. We expect super new technologies.
00:07:09 [W] Okay. So let's actually look at the results.
00:07:14 [W] It's just a reminder again here green is votes for adopt.
00:07:18 [W] The blue is for trial yellow Force s and then gray is for hold and then we took probably the top 15 or so.
00:07:31 [W] Answers that we had all equal I believe was not didn't end up in here right? Jackie know it. Yeah. Anyways way down there for my responses perspective as well.
00:07:48 [W] Yeah, Maya, you can say something.
00:07:52 [W] I don't think I was going to say much but I think it was I don't know. Like I said to my expectations earlier, I kind of expect the people to stick with the technologies that they were comfortable and familiar with and I felt like the results kind of showed that right
00:08:08 [W] responses perspective as well
00:08:12 [W] Yeah, Maya, you can say something.
00:08:16 [W] I don't think I was gonna say much but I think it was I don't know. Like I said to my expectations earlier, I kind of expected people to stick with the technologies that they were comfortable and familiar with and I felt like the results kind of showed that right
00:08:46 [W] A lot of yeah, yeah lot of well-known names up at the top.
00:08:53 [W] So when we came to choosing which ones ended up in adopt trial and assess, I think these are just kind of bucketed like this.
00:09:04 [W] I know there was a little bit of discussion about some of these items where they are there any here that you use or you thought were you know, personally you would put in a different place.
00:09:20 [W] A dreamer heavy users of my SQL.
00:09:25 [W] This is a our main database.
00:09:27 [W] And yes, I can see that most of the adapter Technologies.
00:09:33 [W] We are reusing them except using a post positive group has rescued because we chose the my SQL.
00:09:42 [W] We use proper mongodb pretty heavily at indeed.
00:09:45 [W] And that was one of the things I thought was really interesting the fall into the trials yet, but there is a lot of people that kind of like marked it as like colds don't quite adopt yet and and so it was kind of a interesting experience to see that
00:10:02 [W] I remember Jackie when we were doing this you thought that postgres you are surprised that a lot of people are using postgres, right?
00:10:08 [W] Yeah.
00:10:09 [W] I mean way more than my skewers you can see here.
00:10:12 [W] Pretty heavily at indeed.
00:10:14 [W] And that was one of the things I thought was really interesting the fall into the trial docket, but there is a lot of people that kind of like marked it as like hold still quite adopt yet and and so it was kind of an interesting experience to see that
00:10:30 [W] I remember Jackie when we were doing this you thought that postgres you are surprised that a lot of people are using postgres, right?
00:10:37 [W] Yeah.
00:10:38 [W] I mean way more than my skewers you can see here.
00:10:41 [W] We've been we migrated up not at Ticketmaster my previous place. I believe who 20 years ago.
00:10:49 [W] We might get it off a post request on to mySQL.
00:10:51 [W] And since then I've been working with mySQL almost every place I work for but recently at
00:11:00 [W] Take a master post by came back.
00:11:02 [W] I mean at least from a vendor supported service.
00:11:07 [W] They provided and postgres SQL was the beckoned.
00:11:11 [W] So to me that was a little bit surprising especially looking at the results here that post-crisis wife more widely adopted them MySQL.
00:11:21 [W] You go into a little bit more detail. Like why why did you migrate off postgres in that previous world?
00:11:28 [W] And then once that was a long time ago, I'll main database I work for is P. That was what you know when we have doubt ups and DSL I'm aging myself here and and basically it was our main
00:11:43 [W] Our main database I work for is P that was when we have doubt ups and DSL I'm aging myself here.
00:11:52 [W] And and basically it was our main registration application and it was really heavy at the time people are signing up left and right and supporting postgres SQL was just too heavy for us and
00:12:08 [W] Open source database that we can migrate to it was it wasn't an easy effort when I left it was still finalizing the migration and MySQL at that time works for us.
00:12:22 [W] It was super light and the operation costs for MySQL so much lower than post Quest SQL and finding expertise at that time.
00:12:32 [W] We call them dbas right finally expertise for MySQL at that.
00:12:37 [W] At time with so much easier than postgres dbas.
00:12:43 [W] So when we make the decision and then on the application side of the world's postgres didn't handle updates as well as MySQL.
00:12:53 [W] And so when people were doing updates and it needed to kind of update any indexes there is a cascading right problem, which kind of performance considerations. Yeah. In fact, I think we talk in a little
00:13:07 [W] Bit about how the different how difficult it is to move between databases.
00:13:12 [W] So I think actually we should go into that.
00:13:16 [W] Yeah, so I asked you to sort of come up with some thoughts about what themes or patterns that you see not just from the data, but from your own experience, so Maya, why don't you talk about this first one?
00:13:31 [W] the one of the big things that I had noticed with a lot of our Cloud migration is a lot of were really cautious with our data and we tried moving from database a the database be and there's obviously a lot of overhead involved when you have to move like
00:13:42 [W] It's worth of data from one data storage technology to another I remember running math to try to figure out what kind of like right workloads capacity.
00:13:40 [W] We needed to stay on top of our rights for the day. And there was just a lot there to take into consideration and we ended up like not choosing to adopt any new technologies. But even in our move to the cloud, we're still kind of considering like keeping the same things that
00:13:55 [W] We ended up like now choosing to adopt any new technologies. But even in our move to the cloud, we're still kind of considering like keeping the same things that were familiar with we have a lot of operational excellence around things like my SQL as well
00:14:09 [W] Have a lot of operational excellence around things like my SQL as well as all of our applications are programmed against that so it's you know the cost of switching from one technology to the other often has a height of hicaps to pay.
00:14:27 [W] But that's actually also what you mentioned in terms of the hiring right Jackie the yeah finding people have skills.
00:14:36 [W] and a lot of Engineers when we interview them they are looking from you know challenges new the next new shiny toy to play with and you know when they hear about Oracle or when they hear about running on Prem
00:14:52 [W] You know challenges new the next new shiny toy to play with and you know, when they hear about Oracle or when they hear about running on Prem. They they shy away and a lot of times
00:15:11 [W] She'll way and a lot of times company make decisions, you know based on some of those responses and newer technology it sort of Attraction right to work for a company and
00:15:26 [W] Son of a traction right to work for a company and what not like my are going to a start-up.
00:15:31 [W] It's a you have to choose you don't want to choose the Legacy systems and Technologies. And and that's why the newer Technologies should be there. I mean it shows on our radar to so
00:15:47 [W] so you said you're in the middle of looking at a change right now Dailymotion, right?
00:15:54 [W] Can you talk a little bit about the challenges that you've seen there?
00:16:01 [W] You're on meat say.
00:16:09 [W] Yes still on mute. I'm afraid.
00:16:14 [W] I don't know. Why. Okay, so okay. So I was HOH saying that the emotion and as I said, I'm in charge of the devops team and my team is responsible of giving the main building blocks that I would say
00:16:29 [W] of to to build is application architecture and one of the pieces we want to provide these to provide an easy way to to distract the database system database software and
00:16:45 [W] Truffle database system database software and we were looking at the club knative altinity this in the in the market and we did po Caesar last year in order to
00:16:54 [W] You know to choose the one that fits our knees.
00:16:59 [W] And we are pretty happy because there's some of our internal crews are currently running in production on that solution.
00:17:10 [W] Team, I like sharing with that one was yes, we're working with tidy Beach tidy tikv, and we we deployed it on projections for internal uses.
00:17:24 [W] How has that been working with it out of curiosity?
00:17:28 [W] How is it?
00:17:29 [W] How is it working today working with tikv tid be coming from like the I guess like your previous standpoint.
00:17:38 [W] Yes, but we do the shows because because we did a lot of performance tests tests and reliability test with it cows testing using the tool name the chaosmesh.
00:17:49 [W] We we pushed a lot deal the solution to be sure that it handles.
00:17:57 [W] I was traffic big traffic because we have the we have the target to have a lot of traffic in this platform and and we met everything to be a
00:18:12 [W] Backups regular backups scheduled backups. Do you think GOP Otto is pretty amazing because it it allows you to Define really easily how you want to declare your data is and
00:18:27 [W] And all the observability features are really amazing in this in this solution every I was pretty surprised by the maturity of this solution because it's not known renown.
00:18:31 [W] But when we did our test and compare to the other solution, this is a one shot.
00:18:40 [W] Okay, I think let's go to the second theme out of three and choosing a manage database service depends heavily on your use case.
00:18:50 [W] It's mean do you want to talk about this one?
00:18:53 [W] Yes, sir.
00:18:57 [W] Actually when we when we have seen the results, we were pretty surprised by the the fact that managed Services were not too much.
00:19:10 [W] Got we were expecting that. There will be much more adoptions with the manage database services.
00:19:19 [W] But actually when we talked about that depends, it depends on the company use case. And when where the application is deployed.
00:19:29 [W] what is the cloud provider and sometimes the database just run on premises?
00:19:35 [W] So that's why you maybe that can explain why we don't see much more other option in this area.
00:19:45 [W] Region, it's great. The cloud AC is pretty close to our own planet that has ended there. But on the west side, it's it's it more, you know, it's too far and we constantly hitting some latency issues and
00:19:58 [W] I'll use case is kind of a little bit different between us he's and how West regions and so that's what we're still looking into.
00:20:06 [W] What are the alternative as we move off of on-prem from Oracle to to anything out there that's in you know may not be just one to one migration. We are looking at multiple Solutions.
00:20:20 [W] I know that when we were diving in we looked at things like elastic search for an example and comparing like our on-premise configuration versus the cloud configuration that we could get from something like AWS and did some pretty heavy performance
00:20:35 [W] found that we could run elastic search not only cheaper than what like AWS was offering but also like with higher performance and so we did a lot of things like that when they were diving in I think when we were doing that evaluation we are on
00:20:48 [W] E 2 instances and not necessarily running in kubernative 'yes, but it was something that was like we kind of again kind of take to heart when we look at some of this stuff in like really trying to take our car use cases in this consideration.
00:20:50 [W] We also have like another ephemeral testing type of
00:20:57 [W] effort in place where people wanted to be able to spin up kind of like feature branches for you know service acts and then have a database that's kind of fresh and brought up and then torn down when that feature branch is deployed and using like a managed service for something like that can be really heavy and really
00:21:12 [W] Built into that workflow and that's where we started looking at more things like running it and cluster alongside the service that you're trying to deploy.
00:21:17 [W] Yeah, I mean some of our developer even when their own my scope within kubenetes instead of using RDS cannot find that interesting.
00:21:26 [W] So even though they're running on E KS so different use cases really depends.
00:21:36 [W] That's actually a really good point because RDS was one of the options that was in here.
00:21:42 [W] It was one of the answers that was there, but it didn't end up in the final radar.
00:21:47 [W] Why is that?
00:21:50 [W] I mean it's vague right when we when I said IDs, which databases are we talking about MySQL Aurora, right or even all goes there as well
00:22:06 [W] That out and because you mean some of the users, you know, they they they answer they adopt IDs but within RDS, you know five or six that that they can choose from so we took that out.
00:22:14 [W] It's kind of vague from from that sense and it's very
00:22:18 [W] You know AWS specific and we try not to you know.
00:22:24 [W] Similar to all co-write right not while not similar to all go but we try to take the vendors and be more.
00:22:32 [W] what's the word non vendor-specific. Let's just say
00:22:41 [W] Okay, great.
00:22:42 [W] I knew that was a question that people are going to ask like where is our DS so figure let's let's get it out of the way.
00:22:50 [W] Let's go to our third theme.
00:22:54 [W] This was just keep an open mind and Jackie.
00:22:58 [W] What does this mean?
00:23:00 [W] Yeah, and I reason why this subject was, you know, wow filling out the radar I get a chance to talk to our database tikv.
00:23:10 [W] And the new to kubernative and we've been trying to work with them to migrate their services onto the cloud.
00:23:20 [W] Of the way, let's go to our third theme.
00:23:09 [W] This was just keep an open mind and Jackie.
00:23:13 [W] What does this mean?
00:23:14 [W] Yeah, and I reason why this subject was, you know, wow filling out the radar I get a chance to talk to our database team and they're new to kubernative and we've been trying to work
00:24:11 [W] And we try to talk to them about my gratings Venture into new technology and don't don't settle for the first one.
00:24:19 [W] They looked at and I reach out to Industry like experts like people here right my Smee and the community and see what their experiences are and learn from that before.
00:24:31 [W] We you know decide on our own so keep an open mind on what's out there and this radar Willie opened up some of our eyes
00:24:42 [W] That reminds me of a point Maya you were making earlier.
00:24:45 [W] You said that cost and performance were some of the things that you are looking at.
00:24:49 [W] So whether other things or maybe you can go into performance a little bit like what do you remember what the things were that you were looking at?
00:24:59 [W] One of the big things I think in kind of this space of like keeping an open mind, right like a lot of pieces of Technology are coming out that are better suited for certain use cases and kind of keeping that in mind.
00:25:12 [W] So we have a pretty high right hi write throughput when it comes to things like processing Canada applications or our job aggregation funnel.
00:25:21 [W] And so we needed to make sure that whatever database technology we chew chose could handle the the write throughput so with
00:25:29 [W] Like cockroach TV works for instance. It has a single no to that connects right setting time.
00:25:37 [W] Did something that was a little bit more saturated to some extent even things like I said earlier was like protocol compatibility where it's like a lot of systems are written against my SQL or some piece of technology
00:25:52 [W] Like redo a lot of that code to then work with something like post grass or another kind of protocol.
00:25:50 [W] It's a lot of work on our engineers and we don't necessarily want to put that kind of toil on them.
00:25:56 [W] And that was one of the other things that we have found with like the test was it didn't handle some of the prepared statements that we were using quite as well and it kind of again for Star Engineers kind of go and reconsider like how their code was being written.
00:26:09 [W] So we were trying to find something that was more, you know, dropping and replace.
00:26:14 [W] Versus we need a burden or Engineers with going and fixing that.
00:26:22 [W] Say maybe you can talk a little bit as bad this as well because you were saying you you're using tidy be so you did choose a new technology performances and reliability.
00:26:35 [W] They are other expects aspects to take into consideration.
00:26:39 [W] I would say all the lifecycle Tools around the software solution the database, of course.
00:26:49 [W] I mean, how do you do backups?
00:26:52 [W] I'll give you dig further when you have an issue observability is really important and how you can get the more information from your sister.
00:27:02 [W] These are some consideration to take into account.
00:27:06 [W] Such most of them are open source, and we need to take into consideration how the community is is maintaining.
00:27:14 [W] How is growing and what is the other option of the open source project?
00:27:23 [W] So you mentioned your your you're using tidy be now they yeah, so the community community backing was part of the decision making for you.
00:27:34 [W] Yes, we have to look to the to the activity and durable visitorial to the number of contributors the the number of stars, obviously and and
00:27:49 [W] Deep the way we can ask for support to the way we can talk with the community and this is something we took into consideration when we retry the solution.
00:27:59 [W] Jackie you're my age you have.
00:28:02 [W] Thought some burlap. I think one of the things I had four I don't know this section was it was really surprising also cannot see graph databases picked up a little bit more.
00:28:10 [W] There's a lot of cases where like a knowledge graph is really useful and the fact that like, I think we had neo4j you show up in there, but it was like the only one that people had and it fell really low and there was maybe only a handful of companies that have been
00:28:26 [W] But it was again like one of those more interesting data points kind of to that point or theme of keep an open mind right like find the database that fits your use cases.
00:28:34 [W] Now, I mean Maya and some in, you know nailed it.
00:28:37 [W] We as we migrate from on Prime and supporting Legacy systems. We need basically keep an open mind.
00:28:46 [W] what for on what's out there Venture into the unknown right A lot of times my team the engines I have every Sprint with the I see them picking the tasks that they're comfortable with.
00:29:01 [W] Keep basically telling them, you know jump out of your comfort zone Venture into something out there and oftentimes try to contribute to the open source Community as well when we bring in technology from there.
00:29:08 [W] So yeah, I of course, I appreciate that given that I work at an open source foundation and
00:29:18 [W] So let's just kind of look at the whole thing kind of in-toto.
00:29:22 [W] So what we ended up with in adopt its minus ql memcached elastic search postgres Cathcart and redis and then we ended up with another sort of six or seven here and then in assess just a few.
00:29:37 [W] so actually like do you have any thoughts for people who are who are looking at this and thinking, you know, if I have to choose a solution today, you know, this doesn't mean like okay, you have to choose something from this section, but
00:29:45 [W] Um, do you have any words of advice for people?
00:29:45 [W] Reach out to your network or join this community here and pick the brains. A lot of brainpower. A lot of Open Source contributors here trying on new things and learn from each other because I learned a lot just
00:30:00 [W] Here and and so don't don't be afraid to reach out for help. And that's the biggest piece that I can say here.
00:30:10 [W] its main Maya
00:30:14 [W] I think of have a problem with that.
00:30:15 [W] really well captured.
00:30:20 [W] Okay.
00:30:21 [W] Well, let me go to the just overall thoughts.
00:30:26 [W] How did you find creating the radar?
00:30:33 [W] As the Jackie said where I was really appreciated to talk with you to share our point of views.
00:30:41 [W] This is it was really interesting.
00:30:43 [W] Thank you, and I learned a lot of things I didn't expect to be honest.
00:30:49 [W] And as Jackie say the talking to each other is really important.
00:30:59 [W] I thought that we are proud.
00:31:01 [W] I'm sorry that I just now I was going to say a lot of it gave me a chance to reach out to teams that I have not talked to for a while, especially the you know, and this time and most of my team work from home anyways, so I reach out to database name and pick their brain
00:31:16 [W] You helped me build this radar.
00:31:16 [W] having been like so engrossed on our persistence platforms that world that was pretty familiar with kind of the indeed side filling in that information wasn't too bad for me the things about the radar process that I thought were really interesting
00:31:32 [W] Was kind of difficult at times to figure out like well should this go in to adopt or should this go into trial?
00:31:27 [W] I think kafka's one of those really interesting ones where it's like a lot of people set of dots but there was still like a few other folks that were like, hold on Kafka and it was kind of interesting that people were submitting hold and so there's kind of some context there.
00:31:40 [W] I felt that was missing and having some of that context probably could have helped us make better determination about like whether or not something could go in the adopt versus trial category.
00:31:50 [W] and that's kind of where we typically leveraged comments pretty heavily of like this is how our use case of this is I think I had put Cassandra in there as an example of like we did a trial deployment of Cassandra a long time ago and
00:32:05 [W] When you adopt versus trial category and that's kind of where we typically leveraged comments pretty heavily of like this is how our use case of this is I think I had put Cassandra in there as an example
00:32:31 [W] Upon the holds for Cassandra, you know, there's a lot that can go into that right?
00:32:37 [W] How was it deployed? Was it deployed with like open configuration or where we recompiling?
00:32:41 [W] It's things internally given indeed comes from an on-prem model.
00:32:45 [W] Like we were most likely taking like whatever was out in open source and rebuilding it running on sent OS and trying to go like our own way versus kind of using the well-known configuration provided by the community.
00:33:01 [W] Awesome.
00:33:02 [W] I mean I want to say thank you to all of you my us Main and Jackie because I really enjoyed working with you and I very very interested and excited to see the results of this.
00:33:16 [W] Same here.
00:33:17 [W] Thank you to everyone here.
00:33:20 [W] Just put minder so you can go into radar dot cncf dot IO and read about this in more detail and take a closer look at the projects.
00:33:30 [W] And if you want to get involved then we want to find out what do you want to hear you can go to this link cncf dot IO / Tech - radar that just redirects to a get harder GitHub issue where you can vote
00:33:46 [W] See for the next version of this radar.
00:33:50 [W] If you want to come in and be part of the radar team like Jackie and Spain and Maya or you want to contribute your viewpoints, then please come and join the end user Community. We'd love to have you.
00:34:03 [W] And if you have thoughts about how this could be better, then please send your feedback to info at cncf dot IO or just to me.
00:34:14 [W] And that is it.
00:34:15 [W] I want to say thank you. Once again to all three of our radar team today for putting the work and the time into this so really appreciate it and really appreciate your time today.
00:34:27 [W] Thank you so much, make sure thank you. Thank you chef.
