00:00:00 [W] Nice and welcome to the future of Linux panel here at Cube Khan.
00:00:07 [W] My name is Vincent bats.
00:00:09 [W] I'm CTO at Kinfolk have been in the container space for a long time.
00:00:13 [W] is and I will kick off the introductions with our panelists today with a brief question to get the conversation started so mole on it if you will does it still make sense
00:00:29 [W] It's to run a general purpose operating system Linux operating system In This Cloud native world.
00:00:35 [W] Let's kick off our round of introductions Christian.
00:00:39 [W] Why don't you go first?
00:00:40 [W] sure.
00:00:43 [W] So I'm in the middle of a transition.
00:00:44 [W] I was at canonical for 15 years and I've about to to join a new company in Brazil That's through an acquisition of a side business that I had.
00:00:54 [W] This company is a big retailer called magazine luiza or magalix have a huge technology team and their buildpacks.
00:00:58 [W] Big users of communities have basically every single technology stack across the company. So it'll be interesting to see from the inside what the user perspective is.
00:01:07 [W] Yeah.
00:01:08 [W] So being it canonical for 15 years.
00:01:12 [W] You probably have some opinions on general purpose Linux.
00:01:15 [W] Yes, I think so.
00:01:16 [W] Yes II had opinions before that already, but I think I tend to canonical are cemented that as well is the OS relevant. I think this looks big technology transition, and those are always interesting and prodyna.
00:01:29 [W] kind of kind of unexpected results the big questions I think are going to be what how will the distro vendors react to the change that cloud native brings if
00:01:44 [W] Platform is and this shows basically have built this value of being a bridge between upstreams that release at their own Cadence that develop on their own timelines and priorities to what users expect in terms of maintainability.
00:01:59 [W] A of long time since a long-term support or predictability of release like how it is that value translate into a world where developers are picking all the components that go into the into the Container itself.
00:02:11 [W] What about the interface between kernel and the user space since you don't have a kernel inside the container you have to use the host containerd.
00:02:19 [W] So those are the interesting questions a little bit better. They are iot well and I won't spoil for estupendo. I have some of the big existential questions for people that are building general-purpose linbit.
00:02:29 [W] Taxes in general nice.
00:02:31 [W] Nice nice.
00:02:32 [W] All right, next up Dusty.
00:02:35 [W] What is your opinion?
00:02:38 [W] Hey everybody.
00:02:39 [W] My name is Dusty.
00:02:40 [W] Maybe I'm an engineer at Red Hat.
00:02:42 [W] That's kind of how I know Vincent.
00:02:44 [W] We used to work together a little bit.
00:02:45 [W] I started out my career even before red hat in the telecommunication space but then came to Red Hat and since to have focused on kind of the containerless space first with project Atomic Atomic host
00:03:00 [W] And most recently with the acquisition of coral Wes ink of the emerging of containerless X and atomic host into our Upstream Fedora core OS which is where I spend most of my time and then also Red Hat Coral West which is part of openshift.
00:03:15 [W] um, so that's kind of where I've been as far as you know, a general-purpose OS in a cloud knative World, obviously, we're getting more to the point where you know, special-purpose OS is or container focused OS is seem
00:03:31 [W] You you know solve some needs that platforms have on top, but at the same time I don't think necessarily general-purpose OS is are going anywhere soon.
00:03:42 [W] I mean, we really leverage in this special container OS is we leverage the ecosystem that the general-purpose OS is provide in our case. We have Fedora we have Braille, but there's
00:03:58 [W] Rarely a new container OS that you see that starts completely from scratch.
00:04:02 [W] So there's always a role to be played there.
00:04:07 [W] That's fair.
00:04:09 [W] All right.
00:04:10 [W] Thank you and Tasha, don't you go next?
00:04:12 [W] ?
00:04:14 [W] Hey Natasha Drew.
00:04:15 [W] I'm director product incubation at VMware in the office of the CTO.
00:04:18 [W] I was responsible for launching the VMware tons of kubernative grid service for vsphere and I was part of the team that launched
00:04:27 [W] project Pacific or vsphere with han-soo. I'm also co-chair of the multi-tenancy working group for kubernative.
00:04:33 [W] He's and co-chair of Sig usability.
00:04:36 [W] And as far as the question about operating systems, I think that they're sort of like an interesting historical separation of operations teams and application development teams that
00:04:51 [W] Altered in this drive towards having like this golden image that may not have anything to do with the applications being deployed on it.
00:04:58 [W] So a lot of things have gotten baked into the operating system layer that the applications deployed on it don't actually need and being able to have more purpose-built operating systems that serve the needs of the applications running on it makes a lot of
00:05:13 [W] Sense in terms of just minimizing your Footprints having fewer attack vectors and not shipping a lot of stuff in that lower level that you don't actually need and so I think a lot of it kind of comes down to the build
00:05:28 [W] Tool systems that we have.
00:05:30 [W] I still think there's a ton of value in the people who are doing all of the back-breaking work of maintaining the base operating system components that everybody leverages and the community that works on maintaining those as well and proliferating them.
00:05:43 [W] So yeah, I kind of have a little bit of a mixed bag opinion.
00:05:47 [W] Yeah, that's a split view on but it is interesting to the even, you know saying Ops forces apps versus apps teams.
00:05:57 [W] It's does kind of give two completely different like focal points of the same set of software Darrin.
00:06:04 [W] I probably leaves pretty well into how you have operation teams versus enabling apps teams.
00:06:11 [W] Don't you go next?
00:06:12 [W] Yeah.
00:06:13 [W] Yeah.
00:06:13 [W] Yeah.
00:06:13 [W] Yeah.
00:06:13 [W] Yeah.
00:06:13 [W] Yeah. I'm some German Shepherd CTO and co-founder at Rancher Labs Rancher. We do multi cluster management kubernative use and we've also done some container optimized os's. Yeah, so that's my background.
00:06:27 [W] Ground. So regarding this question going to like I could I could probably like a monologue for the next half an hour about the answer this question.
00:06:36 [W] I don't do it.
00:06:37 [W] Yes, so I'm gonna keep it short but does it make sense to run a general-purpose OS in the cloud knative world, I would say no, but it's actually a significantly more nuanced than that because you know, it's like what do you call
00:06:52 [W] Our purpose OS and and you know, it's like well if I'm saying the answer is no does that mean that the death of a Ubuntu or red hat or something?
00:06:59 [W] You know, that's not true because it's really all of the definitions of these things are changing like the assets that come from a Linux the ecosystem or vendor all completely still relevant, but they're just packaged
00:07:15 [W] Labored in a completely different way because like I don't even really like the term of container optimized Linux because the reality of when you look at these things is they almost have nothing to do with containers except for the fact that they have doctor or Padma nor kubernative.
00:07:27 [W] Zon it it's like containerd optimize Linux is still a general purpose tool is because they can run basically any any any workloads.
00:07:35 [W] It's just how the workload is packaged and delivered. So I think there's a huge transition that we're going to see is we're going to the cloud native world of like how users interact with the Linux.
00:07:44 [W] Ocean what they're expecting from it. And I also see a lot of interesting opportunities for kubernative eyes and kubernative distributions to effectively replace.
00:07:54 [W] What is Linux distributions today.
00:07:56 [W] And sorry that's a little off-topic.
00:08:00 [W] I'd say something real short and I'll stop it's just that the Linux distribution today is really a colonel and a set of user space. Right? And so they're a bunch of userspace packages that run on the colonel right? So when you look at kubernative our view of a kubernative,
00:08:14 [W] She's very naive right now.
00:08:16 [W] I think is very myopic is because we have kubernative he's but then we have a whole host of applications and software that runs on top of it and like you see that from the cncf landscape, you know, the gigantic slide of all this crap good software.
00:08:30 [W] Sorry not crap.
00:08:33 [W] And so, you know how you know, there's there's still the fundamental need that Linux distributions always providing which is like delivering packages that run on the colonel. Now we kind of need the same thing in the cloud negative space so it's like but
00:08:48 [W] Those packages that we run on top of kubernative.
00:08:51 [W] They still have Linux that's inside of them.
00:08:53 [W] They still have gilepsy and they still have you know, Java runtime. They're all the you know, so this is just all changing that that's basically hmm.
00:09:00 [W] I do think lots of Lessons Learned of software packaging in general that have been invented and reinvented and so so many ways and we're just going to reinvent them again and the containerd space so good good
00:09:15 [W] So then with that I would like you you you're talking about, you know, everybody's kind of mentioned like the way that these things are changing and even to some extent kind of implying that obviously there's enough
00:09:30 [W] players in the scene that are interested in seeing it play, you know play out and I think one of these things that's interesting is that it's like yeah, I don't think that any of the general purposes are going OS is are going away and I don't think they need to
00:09:45 [W] But in some ways the pie is just getting bigger.
00:09:48 [W] So like what what purpose they did is fine, but the cloud native space is expanding out. And so with that you've seen, you know different Cloud providers come up with either their own, you know optimize OS
00:10:03 [W] Linux OS and then you know that all of them are trying to compete for different kinds of managed kubernative offerings.
00:10:10 [W] Do you think that that's going to have an impact on the the kind of broader market?
00:10:16 [W] So like if we say OK there's general purposes and then there's all these derivatives but now there's like a competition for optimized derivatives and people won't have maybe what they were familiar with but it kind of Narrows down, you know for whatever particular
00:10:31 [W] Going to use case like Cloud vendor optimized what kind of impact do you think that will have on the market?
00:10:38 [W] I want to go first on that one.
00:10:39 [W] Let me let me take a bridge from what Darren said. I think Darren's points.
00:10:43 [W] The main point is that while the companies themselves and like the core assets that they have may not change like what what gets delivered twin customers. I think has to change if there's no question. And the thing is that the the piece of the operating system that runs
00:10:59 [W] Need the container and kubernative that is going to that is although the colonel is really relevant.
00:11:03 [W] It's so small like the number of components. There is so little that there is like actual value in the cloud provider or whoever's preparing the whole stack giving optimizing that entire layer.
00:11:15 [W] So I think that's something which is absolutely a likely Trend to come that's they will optimize this deliverable which is there anything like how much is that actually Linux, you know, okay, it's Linux from the kernel perspective. What else is there? Like there's not
00:11:28 [W] A lot there, you know that that's it serves enough scaffolding for your boots that are the containers off.
00:11:36 [W] There's one wild card on that though, which is that as you move into Enterprise.
00:11:41 [W] Everyone says, oh hold on, but I need to run my asset tracking or any to run like what my my IDs pieces on this layer as well.
00:11:49 [W] So I think that's the only piece where I'm not sure what the future actually will look for that but that's something specific to be delivered for that. That's small.
00:11:58 [W] Atomically updatable safe to basically roll back and forward.
00:12:04 [W] I think that's definitely coming.
00:12:06 [W] The question is this thing? Like what do you do? Like when somebody says, oh, I need to put my put the BMC agent on this and people are like, well, you can install any software on the Slayer like yeah.
00:12:15 [W] Packages at what do I do?
00:12:16 [W] I probably even more scary than that, you know, like somebody's looking at a checklist and they say well it says here I have to deploy to X is this X and you say yeah.
00:12:26 [W] Well no, it's a better derivative, you know.
00:12:28 [W] Yes, I don't even know what I kind of like it's that question doesn't compute in the context of where it's Landing.
00:12:33 [W] Yeah, like isvs ice V certification is a big deal to you know, it took a lot of people and I kinda have to run this OS because that's what you know, this vendor has certified on which completely changes when
00:12:45 [W] You know as vendors are starting to package their third party software on top of kubermatic.
00:12:51 [W] What is it now mean to certify, you know, and that's kind of interesting space.
00:12:57 [W] I mean our first question for you there and all that like can you run a workloads is certified for Souza on a non Souza Colonel underneath the container.
00:13:05 [W] Yeah, and even even even Dusty could wade into that one a little bit.
00:13:08 [W] Yeah and what and what does it mean, you know, is there even honestly is there?
00:13:15 [W] Even such thing as can I certify for kubernative in general, you know, or am actually certifying for E KS or or you know, like VMware sweeter or whatever openshift.
00:13:25 [W] those are interesting questions. So but going back to because I already forgot Vince like Vincent.
00:13:32 [W] What was the original question?
00:13:34 [W] No, this is good.
00:13:36 [W] It was it was more like is it a useful Trend that we see these kind of optimize derivatives because there's a few, you know players in the scene and you know like either
00:13:45 [W] Ben had experience with having kind of an optimized.
00:13:48 [W] Focus but is it a useful useful Trend or is it well, I mean, I'm so interesting fact on the market not so well, I mean it's disruptive for sure like so there's like the bottle rocket and like Google's container optimized,
00:14:03 [W] You know Microsoft I they haven't announced.
00:14:06 [W] I don't think I'll Linux, you know containerd distro, whatever but I imagine one would come at some point.
00:14:12 [W] Honestly, I think it makes total sense for these Cloud providers because it's like what's the touch point of the customer?
00:14:21 [W] It's like the customer are the end user.
00:14:23 [W] They really want kubernative.
00:14:25 [W] He's so why do they need to care about the nodes and what's running in the notes the interfaces kubernative and this is what I like.
00:14:33 [W] It's Tricky, especially if you're a Linux vendor of like well, what does this mean now because effectively that Lennox layer is the kernel itself or the containerless NX whatever is is fairly commoditized foremost, you know, it's like people don't
00:14:48 [W] Really want to pay for it that much and and they since they don't interact directly with it.
00:14:56 [W] It's very hard to differentiate because you know, it's like Ubuntu for example, like they're, you know rise to fame or whatever is all about kind of users interacting with it and enjoying it. Right and if I'm not touching the note OS any more like so it's like the only way to differentiate
00:15:11 [W] if there's I would say maybe there's not even a need to differentiate anymore because if you just say it's commodity, but the only way to differentiate is through capabilities and that's where I still see os's being somewhat important right now is
00:15:26 [W] Is especially let's say like in the edge space where I've been working a lot recently where it's like gpus and devices and and all these things still matter because they very much touch the OS so it's like well your OS is not capable, you know, because it doesn't have these
00:15:41 [W] Whatever proprietary drivers that kind of leads towards like, you know, if you need BMC or you know, it's like it's the capabilities not so much the the the actually interacting in using it I guess.
00:15:53 [W] Yeah, Tasha Tasha do or Dusty you when the white into that one.
00:15:58 [W] Yeah, I mean as far as you know different Cloud providers coming up with their own distros, is that a useful to Trend? I think you can go both ways, right?
00:16:10 [W] It's useful because anytime you bring new ideas to the market.
00:16:13 [W] There's things that can be learned.
00:16:15 [W] But at the same time it also increases fragmentation a little bit like there's now more options and if you happen to be rolling, you know, trying to set up Kuma Nettie's yourself, you know.
00:16:28 [W] The new option to consider which is options are good, but they also might confuse people or lead them down the wrong path at some point.
00:16:38 [W] I'm not sure but I think Darren had a good point which is it depends on who you are. Right?
00:16:44 [W] Are you just clicking a button and having the entire cluster set up for you and it's completely managed not you know, you're not managing the cluster if that's the case then you know the role of the distro.
00:16:58 [W] Does have a lot less of a role at least that you're concerned with, right?
00:17:04 [W] The the OS is still very important.
00:17:06 [W] Every time there's a new security issue that comes out, right but who cares who's responsible for it? Right is the big part and we've seen the the lines
00:17:22 [W] Move more and more towards you know more is being taken care of by something that you Outsource you pay for it.
00:17:28 [W] It's a cloud platform and you care just about your app, right and that service that you're providing to your customers or your users that is giving them value.
00:17:39 [W] And so, you know, Darren is right. If you are a cloud platform and you're offering that abstraction to your users and your users don't care then
00:17:51 [W] then it's probably useful for trim for them.
00:17:54 [W] But if you happen to somebody a big company or whatnot who where you are responsible for that platform. Maybe you're Outsourcing the infrastructure level stuff, but not the
00:18:09 [W] Out form as a service the kubernative level stuff and you also want to be able to take that to other Cloud platforms and not be locked into one necessarily then you do care about the OS still right? You're still making that choice
00:18:24 [W] Send you want to choose your platform based on that so it depends ya know. What a f*** because the you are it's like it's kind of like as we move into this Cloud native world.
00:18:35 [W] It's all kind of reducing the burden on the the operator or whatever.
00:18:40 [W] Even if you're running yourself, you know, click data center or whatever, you know, it's you know, I think Korra Wes in the early days and now Fedora core OS really kind of pioneered this this kind of what is it the self-driving car kind of
00:18:54 [W] mentality of of you know, it just you treat it more like a phone or whatever it just updates and reboots or whatever.
00:19:02 [W] It's all about reducing the the maintenance which which a lot of that also is about reducing the variability in the OS.
00:19:13 [W] So like if you say like the trend is going towards reducing the maintenance and the variability that also means that like, I think
00:19:24 [W] Doesn't get as bad, you know, it's like, you know so much.
00:19:28 [W] It's like it's the thing. Is that a tiny thing that runs underneath underneath the container the line of the containers underneath that what is there?
00:19:34 [W] Yeah, and I think one of the interesting things that's happened is the LTS kernels, you know from Upstream is kind of been and I think that's been a big deal that like, there's actually LTS kernels Upstream.
00:19:46 [W] So that's allowing more distributions and things like that to just say kind of piggyback, huh off of that.
00:19:54 [W] And that kind of keeps the whole industry in sink, which is really quite nice because it's you know, if you're if you're driving, you know, Debbie and is coming up off of that or whatever.
00:20:04 [W] They're trying was trying to kind of aligned to those LTS schedules. Then it also reduces kind of the fragmentation because this kind of point at the end of the day the biggest thing you care about from the Linux, you know from the container side is effectively the you know, the Linux API need
00:20:19 [W] You know as long as that, yeah the that I do want to show you were starting to jump in your dusty had kind of a race condition. There is easy to useful Trend or it mean like is we've almost touched on another thing of like
00:20:33 [W] Do case you kubernative users even care?
00:20:36 [W] What's running underneath?
00:20:37 [W] I mean, yeah, it did in an Ideal World.
00:20:41 [W] They wouldn't have to but like as we were saying earlier when you start getting into what software what your software is certified to run on from a container and host perspective like you from an isv perspective.
00:20:53 [W] You really need to like minimize the possible number of combinatorial, you know Convent like the Matrix like let's make this achievable like to actually say we support our software
00:21:03 [W] So yeah, I would say that it becomes just a supportability problem for the is vs vs as an application developer.
00:21:10 [W] Do I want to care? I really don't write like I kind of just want to care about the exact changes.
00:21:14 [W] I'm making my to my application and have it be as atomic as possible.
00:21:18 [W] But then I always end up relying on something that's at a lower level that ends up making things complicated from the cloud vendors perspectives.
00:21:27 [W] I think releasing their own Linux distributions makes a lot of sense just from cost reduction and
00:21:33 [W] Rising for their exact use case they have a more limited number of Hardware that they need to support so they don't need like something that can really run on the huge swath of things you find in on-prem data centers.
00:21:46 [W] They don't want to necessarily pay a vendor for every time they spin up Lennox, you know, they want to keep all of the money from the customer instead of just a smaller amount. So yeah, I get it.
00:21:56 [W] I don't know that it really translates to on-prem use cases where people are really consolidating their entire security posture around a limited number of Lennox and Windows operating systems.
00:22:09 [W] They need to you know, whether we agree with it or not.
00:22:11 [W] They want to run their virus scanner against every single node, you know, so you just start running into like the exact use cases and like that security checklist.
00:22:21 [W] So yeah, yeah gosh that security checklist. So that's probably pretty perfect.
00:22:26 [W] Doug way are there different kinds of security considerations that you'd have liked for Linux in general when you specifically running kubernative.
00:22:37 [W] So like in this like we know we said Cloud native by and large that's meaning like schedulable workloads that can be put on the cluster somewhere like kubenetes.
00:22:48 [W] So what kind of you know, what kind of security or different security considerations are there for Linux when scheduling it on a kubernative?
00:22:57 [W] kubernative snowed
00:23:00 [W] So let's jump into that one.
00:23:03 [W] I wanted to just highlight something that's it is important to note as well like from an OS vendor perspective. Like there are two like there's operating system beneath the line that runs underneath the containers, but then like the containers are not built out of thin air like there are
00:23:18 [W] Pieces in those containers that come from the oh, like usually that a large part of the container will come from the operating system. Like yeah, and I think that's something which from a security perspective is the very complicated unresolved problem and the transition to
00:23:33 [W] Grenade he's because yeah, even if you statically linked you still had to have a build roots and well, well, the thing is that it's not actually thinking already like makes everybody else.
00:23:40 [W] Look at you and saying okay statically linked what we start doing that in the 90s yet. Look what happened to the components that went into that statically linked thing like like, okay, like where do they come from?
00:23:49 [W] And so now you've got this huge provenance and attestation problem that the distribution is very neatly solved for you because we gpg sign every single binary that comes out there. And so, you know, this binary was built by robots inside a system that in fact, I thought I was
00:24:02 [W] At a building at canonical, you know that that robot built that binary you can go to canonical say that binary there has like it was compromised until you have that perfect chain inside a single distributor.
00:24:14 [W] I was saying no no throw that away and just you know, you're safe guys do whatever you want, you know gonna get GitHub find this thing I get clothes get clean away or even worse like npm install your way into this mess and now like like that is the actual security problem that
00:24:29 [W] Shins ironically are very well set up to solve because again, the DNA of this redistribution is to serve as a bridge between the madness which is upstream and the predictability which end users expect right and I use npm is examples.
00:24:41 [W] It's like the the LSD edition of that Madness, right? So there's a there's a great tweet here recently of like, you know, the statway are it's okay ignore it way, you know introduces many new packages this many vulnerabilities, please donate to the beard
00:24:56 [W] The first ten minutes of anybody using npm is like if you're like for like an old-school persons, like what the hell did I just do you know like this thing imported this dependency which is like ten lines.
00:25:06 [W] What the hell is that?
00:25:06 [W] So anyway, but the point is that that madness has to be resolved some way right?
00:25:11 [W] They're gonna like somebody is going to have to get to give these people that are developing on this side a set of components that they can use safely you're saying statically linking that's cool. But somebody has to be able to press a button and ci/cd and say hey bring in the new versions of these things. Oh, but they can't be a petabyte-scale.
00:25:26 [W] EI breaking otherwise the app breaks, you know like this this sort of things which distributions are very known for like we don't break the destroy the applications if I break your app, I apologize file a bug. I'll revert back that breaking change in the API because I keep stability for
00:25:41 [W] However long I promise to make in distribution like that has to be there's kind of an academic challenge the world like otherwise like we're all the wise. It's like it is proper dystopia, right?
00:25:49 [W] Otherwise like you can't use anything.
00:25:51 [W] I can't use my phone. I can't use the computer because everything is packed across the stack.
00:25:55 [W] So to continue to develop because I want to bring a couple points you've got to wait and we only have like five minutes. So did it?
00:26:02 [W] Oh shoot.
00:26:03 [W] no, but I think this is really really well whatever. It's interesting because I'm saying it but um, yeah, you're biased I see.
00:26:10 [W] This see the Hub but no feel it because I you know before I was saying this like I think the role of the Linux distribution is clearly changing because all of those assets like let's say like your RPMs your Debian packages or whatever like those are all valuable in their well-curated.
00:26:23 [W] That's an extremely difficult thing.
00:26:24 [W] But what's different what's happening now is like the kind of traditional the way things were before is you would install this generic thing and then you would kind of mutate it there into what it was going to be.
00:26:35 [W] You know, that's the way puppet Chef configuration management salt all those things work, you know ansible
00:26:40 [W] As its kind of you form it, you know, it's like this clay that you form into what it's supposed to be once it gets there and we're shifting all of that earlier into the pipeline. And so it's now basically I want to take all of those assets those RPMs or Debian packages
00:26:55 [W] And I want to do one or two things.
00:26:57 [W] I want to build an OS image which then turns into an immutable container optimized Linux or I want to build a Docker packet or dockets you Docker image which then becomes your container runtime. So it's like we're moving this kind of mutability and in assembling of all this stuff
00:27:12 [W] Earlier in the stage to produce these like reusable assets that we can more easily track and you look at the big advantages of containers in general. A lot of it has to do with distribution management pipeline.
00:27:23 [W] That's where you get a lot of the value out of them.
00:27:25 [W] And so it's like by shifting everything kind of earlier and more predictable.
00:27:28 [W] You know, it completely changes good changes the game. So it's like those assets are still useful and I don't think they're going to go anywhere but it's just presented all differently, but people have to our this sounds like that like the sounds like the benefit of one.
00:27:41 [W] People would would solve things at compile time versus runtime like yeah.
00:27:46 [W] Sure.
00:27:46 [W] Yeah exactly some python or Ruby library to explode on the edge and delete into security.
00:27:52 [W] Is that like I don't think necessarily the security requirements of containers change, but security and the models that we have are changing such that we can make it more secure because you know, we're building like we're creating immutable assets that
00:28:07 [W] The points we can cryptographically ensure that the right thing is put there. So it's like what I'm seeing with containers in stuff and all this kind of immutability is that we can greatly increase the level of security because we can you know,
00:28:21 [W] like secure boot fully verify things DM Verity verify the OS if it's immutable the whole stack we can basically can verify everything that's going on because you know, we're changing the way that were packaging and delivering Linux as an
00:28:36 [W] In the software that's running on it like that a lot Tasha Dusty touchy. Why don't you have anything on sale on that?
00:28:45 [W] You know, it just kind of occurs to me that like the one thing we're really not talking about is how some of these Cloud focused forays into Lennox really are under investing in the wide.
00:29:01 [W] Community of people who spend a lot of time maintaining all of the various packages and capabilities that they're all leveraging and you know, I just start thinking about like is Amazon donating to like open SSL right?
00:29:13 [W] Like I mean, it just kind of feels like there is like a certain lack of understanding of how many hard-working people there are like throughout the world who are constantly updating Lennox and like keeping really important packages up to date
00:29:28 [W] But we then I'll consume and leverage and actually like kind of one of my pitches.
00:29:32 [W] sometimes it's like when people are worried about security and Enterprises. I'm like, you should understand every package or deploying and make sure that you're not relying on something that has one guy in Berkeley like desperately trying to keep up to date like on his free time or even when sir,
00:29:48 [W] Fortunately a few years ago, which is yes is what typically happens actually.
00:29:52 [W] Yeah.
00:29:53 [W] Yeah, not only the recent XKCD about you know, one one person out in Nebraska that broke the internet or whatever but now and it is crazy because often when people hear that of like, oh you should you should actually be familiar with the lines of code that you're importing whether it's going coredns p.m.
00:30:09 [W] And it's usually it's like the gut reaction is that it's that's such an overwhelming reaction or you know asked if people just laugh it off as a joke, it's like that is the joke like you didn't own it there for good luck.
00:30:23 [W] Have fun Dusty you have any other comments on that one?
00:30:27 [W] Not specifically though what Tasha just mentioned. I mean obviously yeah, I mean
00:30:38 [W] There are so many weaken the Fedora Community as well.
00:30:40 [W] So that's not a small community either.
00:30:43 [W] No, not not at all. And there's so many people that need many more things for every everything they do every day in the Fedora community in the Debian community and the Ubuntu community and the Jinn to community everybody it
00:30:58 [W] Is you know many different people all over the world many different companies all over the world coming together. And you know, I think I think some of the cloud providers are getting to a point where they realize that if they can't just
00:31:13 [W] Bye forever without heavily investing in this part that they they started to build up.
00:31:19 [W] So yeah, I think it's starting to get a little better. But I'm just one person in the cloud providers, you know, kind of you know, it's like open source kind of started with this
00:31:34 [W] Ideal, you know, it's kind of like the random person contributing and in their free time doing things and they're still a lot of that.
00:31:41 [W] of course, but it's been tricky over the years has as open source has also become the business model. So many companies is is people they're paying people to work on open source.
00:31:53 [W] So now you have a lot of people who get paid to work on open source versus the people who kind of do it in their free time. And so it's very difficult to balance that because a lot of people are making a decent living working on it.
00:32:03 [W] Open source and there's some people who are kind of, you know, giving up their time for free and they really, you know, kind of really shouldn't or maybe they don't want to and it's and it's difficult, but I think the cloudevents have definitely like recognize this and if you know you look
00:32:18 [W] All all three like the big three of Amazon Microsoft and Google.
00:32:22 [W] I mean all of them over the last couple of years have had major pushes and open source space, you know, obviously they open the doors and he's in a lot of ways.
00:32:31 [W] Yeah. Yeah. So it's like, you know, I think things are changing changing for the better but there's always there's always more. I mean I see I always feel so bad for open source maintainers burning out.
00:32:44 [W] You just see it so often. Yeah, it's it.
00:32:48 [W] It is one of those big things that I have to remind people often have like even if you work for somebody, you know, it's still your name on the line when you put up a pfr or LGT.
00:32:58 [W] I'm something yeah, don't forget that.
00:32:59 [W] It's still you as a human.
00:33:01 [W] Yeah. Yeah, so it's a tricky one.
00:33:03 [W] I mean, I don't have any answers or anything.
00:33:04 [W] But yeah, it's something for good in a mindful of well enter and wrapping up. I mean, it's it's pretty interesting.
00:33:10 [W] I think we've covered how the operating system whether it's general purpose or container optimized is still kind of the glue between
00:33:18 [W] people's expectations, you know kind of working with the Upstream having their own Cadence's working with the different companies involved and then Port by and large, you know, we're reusing a lot of these the work done and the kind of like
00:33:33 [W] infrastructure and methodology whether it is for kind of an operation or an application persons piece of it where you are whether you own the whole stack yourself or you wanting to pay somebody for it and then either one of those cases
00:33:47 [W] It is most people are wanting to push for something.
00:33:50 [W] That's more supportable something.
00:33:52 [W] That's more predictable.
00:33:52 [W] So I think that's probably why anybody could argue the case for both general purpose or something container optimized is because I want it to be supportable for their use case.
00:34:01 [W] So Tasha, Darren Christian - Dusty, I appreciate you all for your time. And if there's nothing else than we can probably open up for a few questions.
