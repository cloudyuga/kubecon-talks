00:00:00 [W] That was a lot of work.
00:00:02 [W] Thanks for the help. I don't think I would have done it without you.
00:00:08 [W] I'm glad it's out there.
00:00:17 [W] Oh that you didn't get a tattoo.
00:00:20 [W] Yeah, check it out.
00:00:21 [W] Yeah, it goes right to it.
00:00:24 [W] It's awesome.
00:00:26 [W] Huh?
00:00:27 [W] Well, it was a lot of fun.
00:00:32 [W] I just hope everyone else likes it, too.
00:00:43 [W] Chicken wing chicken wing hot dog in Bologna groaning chilling with my phone
00:01:00 [W] Yeah, okay.
00:00:44 [W] Maybe you can help me.
00:00:46 [W] All right, we're gonna make
00:00:50 [W] an animated Musical
00:00:53 [W] for Thanksgiving.
00:00:54 [W] All right, it's hear me out hear me out.
00:00:57 [W] Okay, all these holidays have these songs and movies and also put where's the Thanksgiving musical we need one, right?
00:01:06 [W] So I got this idea last night and I think it's going to be epic.
00:01:10 [W] Here's the here's my problem.
00:01:12 [W] I don't know how to make a movie and I want to show it in a theater.
00:01:18 [W] We gotta figure that out too.
00:01:19 [W] So right I mean like big screen everyone Thanksgiving come rolling up into theaters and watch this movie.
00:01:25 [W] It's going to be sweet.
00:01:27 [W] So yeah, I just I'm going to research a little bit.
00:01:31 [W] I'll let you know when I find okay it it's gonna be great.
00:01:33 [W] Just trust me.
00:01:34 [W] All right.
00:01:37 [W] Okay, so I've been researching a lot. I watched six YouTube videos.
00:01:42 [W] I know six. I think I'm an expert at making animated films now.
00:01:48 [W] Yeah, so there's a lot involved it has to do with different departments and how the film here is easier if I just show you.
00:01:57 [W] right take a look. They say a picture is worth a thousand words and in the case of a movie. We have a lot of pictures that happen that we call frames that typically there's
00:02:06 [W] In every minute that gives us 1440 pictures that are Eis process to kind of piece together parts of this movie and a typical movie being 90 minutes long gives us a hundred and twenty nine thousand six hundred total frames that
00:02:09 [W] this entire time to make sense of in make movements and if we want to tie that back to how many words we have that's a hundred twenty nine million six hundred thousand words not including spoken dialogue, but let's actually look at how movies made what are the parts that go into it and
00:02:14 [W] Mission so the typical movie is made up into three acts and these acts each have different parts that tell the story or conflict and World building which then each a kind of breaks down into smaller pieces, which is what gets processed and move
00:02:27 [W] The smallest piece we call this shot and a shot is kind of like a camera angle for one piece of a seen multiple these shots make up a scene which Drive the story forward somehow either character development or whatever and those scenes kind of make up a larger
00:02:40 [W] end up making the the shots or the acts as a whole but what goes into these shots specifically as we move through and animate the film we have to do different things to the pictures to make them look
00:02:52 [W] on scene, so
00:02:51 [W] What we start with is what we call the layout departments and layout is is typically just getting the story pieces together with camera angles and its really blocky characters.
00:03:01 [W] It's pieces in the movie that's aren't realistic looking necessarily but it gets the sense of what the entire layout of that picture will be which then moves into animation which where we actually get more emotion from the character.
00:03:14 [W] character. We animate the characters more we give them more personality and how they react to things and how they move in the scene. That's a lot of the animation.
00:03:21 [W] Pieces there we're going to move into a little bit more of what we call FX or special effects, which is basically animating anything.
00:03:29 [W] that's not a character things like water and smoke and fire.
00:03:35 [W] fire. These are all elements of the story that need to move as well, but aren't directly tied to you know, a character themselves.
00:03:44 [W] And we will move into the lighting department which actually brings life to a lot of this stuff. It gives shadows and lighting and makes it look very realistic and and usually one of the final stages and making it animated film
00:03:59 [W] That business is also what we call Stereo or 3D which literally takes the entire movie and renders it twice.
00:04:05 [W] So we have essentially the right or left eye and we shift everything a little bit and render the other side, but let's look at how these different departments affects what our infrastructure looks like for rendering.
00:04:17 [W] So as we go through these different departments are difficulty for what we need to render in our compute resources goes up pretty drastically from layout to animation. We're going to get some complexity.
00:04:27 [W] just in making these scenes but really around effects and lighting and in Stereo is where we get a big spike in the amount of compute resources the amount of machines and computers and stuff like that that we need to kind of make this film and
00:04:42 [W] Shot level but also at the entire movie level as you complete more shots in story.
00:04:35 [W] Not all the shots are completed at the beginning you complete them as you go and so at the beginning you might have ten or a hundred shots ready to kind of animate and go through this process, but you don't get all of the shots until much later.
00:04:46 [W] And so you're going to get this huge Spike of a lot of shots being worked on simultaneously, which means we're going to need a lot of infrastructure later on in the film not as much early on and if you remember the amount of frames we
00:04:59 [W] Ads there's some data out there that a shot or a frame typically takes about 24 hours to render which means if we did this all up front it's going to take us about three hundred fifty five years to complete rendering
00:05:14 [W] Not just making it so we have to do a lot of stuff in parallel, but that also means that we need all this infrastructure around this point and not so much over here at the beginning because it's just not needed at the end of all of that rendering we essentially get
00:05:21 [W] And that's the thing that we take that's the master that we send to a movie theater. And that's what they play on their screen.
00:05:26 [W] So in a lot of cases, this is a physical piece of media that we take a such as a hard drive and sometimes it's digitally sense through different secure mechanisms and encryption, but that's essentially the whole piece of how the movie
00:05:41 [W] some of this infrastructure fits in
00:05:44 [W] so it seems like a lot of work but it's doable. I think between the two of us we can we can make this happen.
00:05:50 [W] We'll get it done in time and it's going to be amazing.
00:05:54 [W] I just think everyone's gonna love this movie so much. Okay still a few things with the infrastructure.
00:05:59 [W] I need to figure out and just the process in general.
00:06:01 [W] So I'm going to go get some stuff.
00:06:04 [W] Okay. So let's look at those compute resources we need because this is going to get complex.
00:06:13 [W] If I'm a single artist with a single machine, it's pretty simple.
00:06:17 [W] I know I render a frame I use all the CPU all the memory. I need I just wait for it.
00:06:25 [W] Alright now the next frame I wait for it.
00:06:28 [W] I ran an ex-friend, you know, this this is a linear process.
00:06:31 [W] This makes sense where this gets complex is if we have lots of artists doing lots of different shots in parallel will probably going to need more machines. So if we
00:06:43 [W] If we take more machines and add them to the equation.
00:06:47 [W] It helps because we can we can distribute this work all over the place.
00:06:52 [W] We could say.
00:06:53 [W] Okay, one two, three, but it's not that simple. Sometimes we do need to coordinate this a little more than just throwing Jabs out there.
00:07:02 [W] You know this this is a linear process.
00:06:59 [W] This makes sense where this gets complex is if we have lots of artists doing lots of different shots in parallel will probably going to be more machines.
00:07:10 [W] So if we if we take more machines and add them to the equation
00:07:16 [W] It helps because we can we can distribute this work all over the place.
00:07:20 [W] We could say.
00:07:21 [W] Okay, one two, three, but it's not that simple. Sometimes we do need to coordinate this a little more than just throwing Jabs out there.
00:07:30 [W] It's not just going to work great to collect everything into a single movie at the end if we're just, you know, if we don't organize this and so we need something some intelligence scheduler that is going to
00:08:06 [W] Organize this and so we need something some intelligence scheduler that is going to coordinate that for us as a shot comes in.
00:08:15 [W] Not only do I need to track where that's going to go how much resources it needs, but I need to track assets inside of the shot itself here.
00:08:26 [W] Let's say I want to render this Bear right?
00:08:29 [W] It's a vacation bear or whatever in the story.
00:08:32 [W] It's fine, but I need to know which version of the shirt I have because the shirt goes through different phases of cycles of being complete with different textures and patterns. The bear the character itself will have different rigging
00:08:47 [W] The nation so the bear might change and I want to make sure when I render its finally I get the latest version of the bear the latest hat in the latest shirt, but what if what if we just change it in the middle of the movie somewhere later on they say oh, it's not a vacation.
00:09:02 [W] Or now.
00:08:56 [W] It's a skateboard. Bear for we change the genre completely and it's not a skateboard bear anymore.
00:09:03 [W] It's a it's a superhero bear.
00:09:06 [W] I don't know these things change the story progresses.
00:09:09 [W] So we need something that intelligently tracks all these assets some sort of asset management system.
00:09:16 [W] And we also need a scheduler that can schedule these jobs and looking back at the compute side of it. If I say, I want to schedule you know this
00:09:25 [W] Frame over here and this one over here.
00:09:27 [W] Usually that's fine for smaller systems that have a handful of cores and memory I can just use the whole system.
00:09:35 [W] But if we get larger systems, we can actually cut those up into smaller pieces and rendered to frames at 1. So we're three on a single system, but we need to be able to isolate that computes and resources separate from each other on the same
00:09:50 [W] Containers are a perfect fit for that right we can we can tell it how much CPU how much memory you can use what sort of Mount file system it can use to get to track the assets and to mount volumes into it.
00:10:01 [W] All those sorts of things will work great. And so we can use those containers on top of this with these high CPU memory jobs and and then we can use our orchestrator to to put those jobs out there in order based on when an
00:10:16 [W] It's or when a shot is done ready to be rendered.
00:10:11 [W] There are a couple things that are still questions here.
00:10:14 [W] Like how do I get metrics from from these jobs?
00:10:17 [W] We probably want something that scrapes them whether that's an agent on the box or something like Prometheus or something pulling that information, but I think I think we're on our way to have something that we can render a lot of this stuff at once.
00:10:33 [W] Like Prometheus or something pulling that information, but I think I think we're on our way to have something that we can render a lot of this stuff at once.
00:10:37 [W] Yeah, so I think this is a good calming will look at kubernative will look at Prometheus.
00:10:44 [W] We gotta find a custom scheduler.
00:10:45 [W] There's there's other ones out there that aren't just these aren't web services.
00:10:49 [W] They are not horizontally scalable.
00:10:51 [W] They take up an entire system. So if I want to add more systems to the to the render
00:10:57 [W] arm, I can't look at CPU and memory usage because in an ideal State a hundred percent of my CPU and memory is being used so I can autoscaler is not going to work for that.
00:11:07 [W] I'm probably going to look at something like queue depth how many jobs are waiting to be rendered and if if I have too long of a queue, maybe I add more ec2 instances or I add more pods to the cluster and
00:11:23 [W] The cluster and enabled I'm able to scale up that way actually seems like a great idea.
00:11:29 [W] Yeah, let's let's try that.
00:11:34 [W] So remember all those assets were tracking and rendering yeah, it's going to take a lot of storage the assets before we render them after iterations edits.
00:11:47 [W] Everything's just going to add up when you log disc for this.
00:11:53 [W] Oh, yeah, and remember that a scheduler we might need to make for the rendering we got to put it in order and everything. I think for our movie we can find one off the shelf.
00:12:04 [W] There's a couple that exists that I'll make basically graphs of assets and dependencies.
00:12:10 [W] So at a larger scale it probably wouldn't work because you're going to have multiple movies going on at once so you need something custom but for us, I think we're okay.
00:12:21 [W] cloud storage
00:12:25 [W] I don't know. I mean, I guess there's options. There's you know plenty of different things we could try.
00:12:35 [W] As long as it's you know, there's it's scalable enough. So that makes sense and
00:12:40 [W] Yeah, it was just a bunch of files. And as long as the artist tools and the rendering engine can access the files and is fast enough. Yeah closed doors actually makes a lot of sense.
00:12:51 [W] What is your than this?
00:12:56 [W] cloud storage
00:12:59 [W] I don't know. I mean, I guess there's options. There's you know plenty of different things we could try.
00:13:10 [W] As long as it's you know, there's scalable enough.
00:13:12 [W] So that makes sense. And yeah, it was just a bunch of files and as long as the artist tools and the rendering engine can access the files and is fast enough. Yeah closed doors actually makes a lot of sense.
00:13:25 [W] What is your than this?
00:13:28 [W] All right.
00:13:29 [W] I think we have everything then let's let's just try the Closet Storage.
00:13:32 [W] It's got to be easier.
00:13:32 [W] So let's get to work.
00:13:38 [W] All right.
00:13:38 [W] Let me tell you a little secret about how movies are actually made first.
00:13:43 [W] You open your app. Second put on your headphones third cut to a montage.
00:14:40 [W] It's done.
00:14:49 [W] I can't believe it.
00:14:50 [W] It's it's done all that work.
00:14:59 [W] I can't believe it.
00:15:00 [W] It's it's done.
00:15:01 [W] Well, I work.
00:15:06 [W] We got to get to the theater.
00:15:11 [W] I'll be back.
00:15:26 [W] Okay, we're gonna do it.
00:15:28 [W] We're gonna make it.
00:15:29 [W] We'll get the movie out in time.
00:15:30 [W] Yeah.
00:15:31 [W] This is it.
00:15:32 [W] This is oh no, they're closed.
00:15:35 [W] Oh, how could they be closed?
00:15:38 [W] No. No, why?
00:16:09 [W] He has of course.
00:16:09 [W] I'm eating my emotions people would like the movie.
00:16:15 [W] It's a bummer that although they're closed.
00:16:18 [W] What you going to do?
00:16:26 [W] Think so.
00:16:29 [W] I don't know that streaming it seems so much work.
00:16:33 [W] Hey.
00:16:57 [W] He has of course. I'm eating my emotions.
00:17:01 [W] I thought people would like the movie.
00:17:03 [W] It's a bummer that all the time they're closed.
00:17:06 [W] What you gonna do?
00:17:14 [W] I think so.
00:17:18 [W] I don't know that streaming it seems so much work.
00:17:23 [W] Besides how would you do that?
00:17:24 [W] I don't like we just built all this stuff for making the movie.
00:17:27 [W] Like, how are we going to stream it?
00:17:28 [W] I don't know.
00:17:30 [W] It doesn't seem like it would work out.
00:17:37 [W] Can't be too hard, right?
00:17:46 [W] I'm still bummed, but I don't know. Maybe it's an option. No look.
00:18:04 [W] Oh, oh good.
00:18:06 [W] You're here.
00:18:06 [W] Yeah, so I was thinking about what you said and I think streaming might make sense.
00:18:14 [W] I mean it's a lot of other stuff to do but I've been I've been researching it a lot and it kind of just picks up where we left off.
00:18:23 [W] we might be able to do that here. Let me show you this is this is what I think so far as what we got.
00:18:29 [W] Okay, so we have this movie file now that we made and we were going to send it to a theater.
00:18:34 [W] And since that's not going to work out. We got to figure out how do we get this to a TV and it turns out that TV's aren't movie theaters.
00:18:42 [W] They don't play the same formats and and who knows how to work those remotes. So what we need to do is figure out first just what's a common format that we can play for.
00:18:54 [W] Can't be too hard, right?
00:19:03 [W] I'm still bummed, but I don't know.
00:19:05 [W] Maybe it's an option.
00:19:05 [W] No look.
00:19:21 [W] Oh, oh good.
00:19:23 [W] You're here.
00:19:23 [W] Yeah, so I was thinking about what you said and I think streaming might make sense.
00:19:31 [W] I mean it's a lot of other stuff to do but I've been researching it a lot and it kind of just picks up where we left off.
00:19:40 [W] So I think we might be able to do that here. Let me show you this is this is what I think so far as what we got.
00:19:46 [W] Okay, so we have this movie file now that we made and we were going to send it to a theater.
00:19:51 [W] And since that's not going to work out. We got to figure out how do we get this to a TV and it turns out that TV's aren't movie theaters.
00:20:00 [W] They don't play the same formats and and who knows how to work those remotes. So what we need to do is figure out first just what's a common format that we can play for.
00:20:09 [W] Let's say this TV here and there a little tricky because there's different models and different formats that they support but let's
00:20:16 [W] Go with something.
00:20:17 [W] That's a little bit standard. I guess or comment for this use case.
00:20:21 [W] Just so how we get media in there. So let's transcode this movie file into something that we expect the TV complacent.
00:20:28 [W] So we'll use this movie and we could send this to TVs right through the mail.
00:20:35 [W] We could actually just like copy these a bunch and put them in envelopes and send them to people and let them play them, but we don't want to use that.
00:20:40 [W] We actually want to stream this online. So the first step we're going to need is some sort of
00:20:46 [W] Like storage of what movies we have.
00:20:48 [W] We need some sort of metadata server some database somewhere that we can put all of these files and all these movies and store this meta data so we can get that later and people can look it up and say, okay.
00:21:00 [W] What's your catalog?
00:21:01 [W] Where is this information?
00:21:02 [W] So let's just have some database and put it in there.
00:21:05 [W] And then what we actually want to do with the file itself is change it and chop it up into little bits.
00:21:11 [W] This is easier to kind of push over two TVs co-star like packets on the internet right we can
00:21:16 [W] Door all these little files with with some reference data what movie it's in what which part of the movie it is and essentially where it's stored and let's put all of those and a bucket somewhere some somewhere we can access online.
00:21:31 [W] I was directly in we can stream it to them. And there you go.
00:21:34 [W] We have a stream on a TV, which is awesome, but not the whole story if we have a TV way over here on the other side of the country.
00:21:41 [W] How are we going to get the files to them?
00:21:43 [W] We could stream them and send them all the way across from our centralized buckets, but that's probably not the most efficient way to do it.
00:21:53 [W] So what we probably want to do is have a bucket that's close to them as well and we can say okay.
00:21:59 [W] Well if we put it here and we sing.
00:22:01 [W] Akron eyes this data, you just put all the files over there, then we can send it and it's a lot closer.
00:22:05 [W] And again this sort of makes sense, but not when we have TVs all over the place.
00:22:12 [W] We can't just put buckets everywhere.
00:22:13 [W] And so for that we're going to have to figure out something else, but we can rely on this thing.
00:22:18 [W] We call the 20/80 rule where 20% of our content is viewed eighty percent of the time which is actually really helpful for us because instead of using these larger buckets with all the information we only
00:22:31 [W] The actually synchronize 20% out to smaller Edge locations and these Edge locations. We can use a CDN and just put them all over the place which is great and 20% of our data goes here and the other 80% can still be fetched from the centralized
00:22:46 [W] But we can rely on this thing.
00:22:31 [W] We call the 20/80 rule where 20% of our content is viewed 80% of the time which is actually really helpful for us because instead of using these larger buckets with all the information.
00:22:43 [W] We only need to actually synchronize 20% out to smaller Edge locations and these Edge locations. We can use a CDN and just put them all over the place which is great and 20% of our data goes here and the other 80% can still
00:23:18 [W] And as the media gets more popular, we can sync it out somewhere else, but now we can sink some of the larger content between these buckets and then from there synchronized to the smaller CDN cache locations and all the TVs can access it
00:23:34 [W] Happens when we look at a global view that still kind of works. We can still store 80% of the content centrally and 20% all over the place, which is actually really great.
00:23:44 [W] So this I think that would scale for us over the globe.
00:23:48 [W] We have the TV here and if you have a TV, you probably have a phone too and there's also a good likelihood that you're going to have a tablet or something and and then maybe even a game console and so how do we
00:24:03 [W] Get files for all of these things.
00:24:05 [W] We can't just send the same files to all of them and we can you know, make multiple copies of them.
00:24:12 [W] But your TV's probably going to have something like surround sound. So we need another version for that.
00:24:16 [W] Oh and maybe you have HDR so we might need another version for that and what if you have a low internet connection, you can't use the really big files so we needed never the version for that and this just keeps going on and on and on and it gets really messy,
00:24:31 [W] Pack all of these files in some in that metadata service so that when the right client tries to access them they get the file that they want.
00:24:38 [W] Let's simplify it though.
00:24:40 [W] Just it's too much.
00:24:41 [W] So now let's look at what it actually takes to open the app from a user perspective.
00:24:46 [W] what sort of infrastructure do we need and we're going to need a few things up front for
00:24:53 [W] like a sign up Service as I need to be able to create an account.
00:24:56 [W] I need to be able to pay for this accounts and I need to probably set up some sort of profile. So we're not going to focus on these but this has pretty standard user databases and PCI compliance for payments and in some other metadata for which sort of
00:25:12 [W] part of a larger accounts
00:25:04 [W] But let's let's focus in on just let's pretend someone has a count already and they're just gonna open the app and try to play a movie.
00:25:11 [W] What does that look like for the infrastructure?
00:25:14 [W] So first up we have the app.
00:25:17 [W] Let's go ahead and open it up and the very first thing of course when you start an app is you need to authenticate.
00:25:21 [W] So we need an authentication and points that we're going to get either a token or username and password just to prove that you are who you say you are.
00:25:31 [W] And this service is going to talk to you what we call a session service, which will actually make a temporary session for us to allow us to get access to the other back end pieces that we might need. So it's going to send basically just some sort of hashed down to the phone that we'll use later.
00:25:46 [W] and the first thing that after we've authenticated as we want to load our home screen or the main page and so we'll look at a list service is what I'll call it here and and this is going to provide us all sorts of information that goes directly
00:25:54 [W] in list is made up of multiple different pieces and combines a lot of this information from that metadata service and other places one of those things that it's going to create or use is a CDN mapping of
00:25:55 [W] Other places one of those things that it's going to create or use is a CDN mapping of which cdns are we using for which locations? Because if we want this to be all over the world will probably need more than one CDN multiple different
00:26:08 [W] Need more than one CDN multiple different cdns will use different networks more efficiently based on peering and Partnerships.
00:26:16 [W] So we want to make sure that we're giving the best CDN for the network and client that someone's using so the second piece here is the client and that depends on what type of phone you have.
00:26:28 [W] what sort of files format does it support what DRM does it support all that kind of stuff comes into this client piece where I can see from
00:26:38 [W] request.
00:26:39 [W] Okay, you're going to want either fair play or some other DRM with this sort of file with this sort of audio with HDR or not.
00:26:49 [W] And then this list will also look at personalization things. Like what's on my playlist?
00:26:55 [W] What's on my watch?
00:26:56 [W] later?
00:26:57 [W] Which things do I recommend to you and personalization is such a long word.
00:27:02 [W] What's not right at that way usually people write it as a number Nim, which is p 1 3 n which is 13 letters in between.
00:27:08 [W] So that's our personalization. Peace. And the final one is this license service, which will depend on
00:27:16 [W] where you're located, if you have meat we have if we have a partnership or meteorites to play that in your country things like
00:27:24 [W] So my watch later, which things do I recommend to you and personalization is such a long word.
00:27:30 [W] What's not right at that way usually people write it as a number Nim, which is p 1 3 n which is 13 letters in between.
00:27:37 [W] So that's our personalization piece. And the final one is this license service, which will depend on where you're located. If you have meat we have if we have a partnership or meteorites to play that in your country
00:28:37 [W] Lee depending on where your geolocation is as well.
00:28:42 [W] So all of these things will work together. So first hour.
00:28:47 [W] Personalization and license service will will give us some content based on where you're located and what we think you'll like and then that CDN and clients will give us what playlist match those files and so we can say, ok. I'm just going to send
00:29:02 [W] Yen and clients will give us what playlist match those files and so we can say ok. I'm just going to send you these files and it's going to have all of the playlist information right embedded into it so that when I when I go to click to play it it's already there
00:29:17 [W] When I go to click to play it, it's already there. And this is going to repeat for all these different files that we want to show on the home screen.
00:29:25 [W] We can do that for this, you know hero bar here, but also for all of the other bars that we might have on the home screen to get you the information you want so you can just start playing it right away.
00:29:36 [W] But what happens if you want to search for something that's a slightly different problem for infrastructure.
00:29:41 [W] So, let's say we want to just text search for a movie.
00:29:46 [W] And the first thing search is going to do is obviously going to work with that list service and the list service also can have collections that are either automatically or curated by a person and so things that go together things like Star Wars.
00:30:02 [W] And the first thing search is going to do is obviously going to work with that list service and the list service also can have collections that are either automatically or curated by a person and so things that go together things like Star Wars movies
00:30:26 [W] We'll go together or animated films all go together.
00:30:28 [W] This is great because we can return all of those if I search for one.
00:30:33 [W] Hey, you probably want to see the other ones as well.
00:30:34 [W] So list is great at that, but the full text search is a little bit more tricky because we need to rely on what you're typing to not only get the words that you wanted, but maybe something similar to those words.
00:30:47 [W] So if you type in a search, let's look at how that flows in this text situation will use that metadata service that we had before and we can probably just put solar or elastic search in front of it for a full text sort of view of that
00:31:03 [W] But just then we can dump the information in there based on ingest. So when we pull in a file, we can throw that into elastic search but it full text search of that is going to be a little cumbersome sometimes so we might need to change that and use something
00:31:18 [W] Graphql API probably makes a lot of sense here because we can more fine-tuned the query that we want to make and the big benefit here is that 80/20 rule is we can cash it. So 80% of our searches will
00:31:27 [W] And we only have to rely on Alaska search for the last twenty percent. So I type something in here into the text field go to graphql that's going to look up in the cache if it's there if it's a cache, Miss.
00:31:37 [W] Okay.
00:31:37 [W] Now we need to actually fetch the full text and get the result that you are looking for so we can combine both of these back-end apis into this main search API and whenever I search for something send them the the one or two files that we
00:31:52 [W] For a result. So here comes our results and once we get the movie that we actually wanted to watch that shows up here.
00:32:00 [W] And what does it look like to play a movie finally were there right?
00:32:03 [W] And again, this has all that information of a playlist for where it's located.
00:32:09 [W] I can just go access those files directly, but we're missing a step here.
00:32:13 [W] There's DRM on these files. How do we understand and read these good encrypted files with the DRM?
00:32:20 [W] So again, these files are just stored in this bucket DRM wrapped depending on the clients.
00:32:27 [W] And so we need to talk to some DRM service in remember our session token that actually is what we're going to use.
00:32:34 [W] So the DRM back-end knows that our session is going to be valid based on their own communication. But also which token we get and it's going to give us a key that will allow us to locally decrypt those files.
00:32:45 [W] We don't want to do that prior to this. So once I find linkerd
00:32:50 [W] Hit that key from the DRM service.
00:32:52 [W] I can access those files and there we go.
00:32:55 [W] Now we're loading now we can press play.
00:32:59 [W] Except for a couple small things while I'm playing this movie.
00:33:03 [W] I'm gonna have a heartbeat service something that's actually going to call out to some other back ends just to kind of let us know where we're at.
00:33:10 [W] Just to make sure that my session is valid that I still have access rights to, you know, get this content that I can still do things. But that new session also works with this DRM service to make sure that if the DRM
00:33:22 [W] Miles or certain formats?
00:33:18 [W] I'm still able to decrypt those and all of that works in session session Works in concert together to make sure that I'm getting the right information.
00:33:29 [W] And so if what happens if I go offline right like my heartbeat stops. Now, what do we do? This is exactly the same problem as say download, you know and watch offline in this case.
00:33:41 [W] I get a slightly different DRM key probably that will give
00:33:44 [W] me a longer lease on watching those files so I can prefetch all of the files from wherever they're located in the best formats and my dear m key will expire at some point, but it'll be more Long Live than if I'm watching with
00:33:59 [W] So this is great because once I come back online, I can refresh my session and ERM token and everything else just works the final two pieces here that we want to actually heartbeat to our what we're just gonna call the watch endpoints and the metrics and points.
00:34:13 [W] So watch is super critical for things like continue watching as I'm watching this movie.
00:34:20 [W] I'm constantly sending backs a little bit of information where I'm at in the file which movie I was watching. Which timestamp I'm at
00:34:29 [W] Really matters for when I want to pick it up later either on another device or just later in the day or tomorrow or something like that.
00:34:35 [W] And then this metrics and point gives a lot of performance about what it looks like to stream. This movie is my network still fast enough is the device is the format good for this device.
00:34:49 [W] have I had any latency or issues and being able to get that from the client side and match that up with what the backend is seen is huge.
00:34:58 [W] We important to be able to understand the performance of the entire stack and so I can I can get a can get metrics from both sides and then get a bigger picture a better picture of what's happening in the service and
00:35:14 [W] You're either on another device or just later in the day or tomorrow or something like that.
00:35:11 [W] And then this metrics and point gives a lot of performance about what it looks like to stream. This movie is my network still fast enough is the device is the format good for this device.
00:35:24 [W] I had any latency or issues and being able to get that from the client side and match that up with what the backend is seen is hugely important to be able to
00:35:36 [W] understand the performance of the entire stack and so I can I can get ax I can get metrics from both sides and then get a bigger picture a better picture of what's happening in the service and that's just a huge win.
00:35:50 [W] win. So there we go. Now we're watching a movie all of those pieces come together to put this movie together and stream it to my phone.
00:36:01 [W] Okay, so I mean that's a lot right?
00:36:04 [W] There's a lot of stuff going on there.
00:36:05 [W] We have to track all the assets we have to distribute them, but we can rely on cloud services for that their cdns that just exists and can distribute it and we already have the file we can just upload it and it does all that, you know
00:36:46 [W] A huge win.
00:36:48 [W] So there we go.
00:36:48 [W] Now we're watching a movie all of those pieces come together to put this movie together and stream it to my phone.
00:36:58 [W] Okay, so I mean that's a lot right?
00:37:01 [W] There's a lot of stuff going on there.
00:37:02 [W] We have to track all the assets we have to distribute them, but we can rely on cloud services for that.
00:37:08 [W] There's cdns that just exists and can distribute it and we already have the file we can just upload it and it does all that, you know transcode it and cut it up all that stuff's going to make sense.
00:37:20 [W] It's going to be a little tricky with all the different platforms and end points, but I think we can do it and
00:37:27 [W] The infrastructure do it all in the cloud use the services that exist already asked Kinesis.
00:37:34 [W] And of course, we'll use some Lambda and step functions and kubernative and all that stuff.
00:37:38 [W] That's all going to be there.
00:37:39 [W] But really the end of the day, we just want to get the movie out there and this instead of the one theater. We can go everywhere right directly to the consumer.
00:37:50 [W] Oh, I think they'll pay me 5 bucks a month.
00:37:53 [W] I mean, that's not bad.
00:37:56 [W] I think we should do it.
00:37:57 [W] All right, let's go.
00:37:59 [W] Let's get start.
00:38:29 [W] Yeah. No, I think it's ready the websites up.
00:38:34 [W] I mean, we're it's going to go live here.
00:38:37 [W] Look that's it. I mean we can you can get to it right there.
00:38:44 [W] Here we go.
00:38:45 [W] there
00:38:48 [W] here we go.
