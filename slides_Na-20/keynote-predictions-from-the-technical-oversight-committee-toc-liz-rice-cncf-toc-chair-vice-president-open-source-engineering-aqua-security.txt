00:00:00 [W] Kubernative will be boring as soon as we can make it boring.
00:00:03 [W] Maybe after I retire it's already boring.
00:00:06 [W] So I think we're well on our journey towards kubernative being boring.
00:00:10 [W] It'll only be boring when it's done.
00:00:12 [W] It'll only be done when it's no longer relevant.
00:00:53 [W] It'll only be boring when it's done.
00:00:56 [W] It'll only be done when it's no longer relevant.
00:01:54 [W] Our job is to make kubernative easier and easier and easier to use either from an Ops point of view or developer point of view while acknowledging it is complex because we're solving a complex problem.
00:05:45 [W] Kubernative will be boring as soon as we can make it boring.
00:05:48 [W] Maybe after I retire.
00:05:51 [W] It's already boring.
00:05:52 [W] So I think we're well on our journey towards kubernative being boring.
00:05:55 [W] It'll only be boring when it's done.
00:05:57 [W] It'll only be done when it's no longer relevant.

00:07:33 [W] Hello everyone and welcome to day 3 or day for depending if you do index starting at 1 or 0 to Coke on North America 2020 in the last set of key notes.
00:07:42 [W] Really well, and so to validate my assumption, please do the round of applause for everyone over the past few days both in terms of kolos events and Keynotes and amazing presentations.
00:07:39 [W] And so to start off the first keynote of the day.
00:07:44 [W] we are going to be hearing from the lovely my lovely co-chair Steven Steven Augustus, you know, you should probably should be familiar to you by now. He is a senior open source engineer of VMware and today
00:07:58 [W] say he will discuss slowing down the release Cadence of kubernative with a more deliberate not deliverable deliberate approach, please welcome back Steve and Augustus and let's give him a round of applause and Slack
00:08:20 [W] Hello.
00:08:21 [W] Hello everyone.
00:08:23 [W] My name is Steven Augustus. And I am one of your co-chairs for Kube con Cloud native con and a virtual 2020 when I'm not reviewing your lovely Toc submissions or putting
00:08:38 [W] black
00:08:38 [W] hello.
00:08:39 [W] Hello everyone.
00:08:40 [W] My name is Steven Augustus. And I'm one of your co-chairs for Kube con Cloud native con and a virtual 2020 when I'm not reviewing your lovely Toc submissions or putting
00:09:16 [W] A program for what?
00:09:18 [W] I truly believe is one of the best conferences in the world.
00:09:21 [W] I am a senior open source engineer at VMware now it's in the title, but let's go a little deeper on the open-source bits.
00:09:33 [W] My day-to-day is spending time in a open source project that is near and dear to my heart and you may have heard of it.
00:09:43 [W] It's called kubernative.
00:09:46 [W] So today I wanted to take some time to talk to you a little bit about the kubernative A's project and more specifically the release cycle for the kubernetes project now.
00:10:02 [W] In the community I serve as a co-chair for Sig release as well as one of the senior release managers now what that means is honestly I have I have the opportunity to interface with
00:10:16 [W] I have the opportunity to interface with a bunch of lovely people to manage a group of rock stars.
00:10:20 [W] really. So I wanted to I wanted to give you a little bit of their view into the release cycle and some of the discussions that we've had across 2020.
00:10:36 [W] Now something interesting happened in 2020, and I'm not sure that it has happened to frequently if at all in the project and that's we slow down. We slow down the release Cadence during
00:10:51 [W] The 119 release and we did it. Deliberately.
00:10:56 [W] We did it to give an opportunity for people to to really live through the the 2020 of it all and in making that decision it was it was not about technology.
00:11:12 [W] It's 20 of it all and in making that decision it was it was not about technology.
00:11:15 [W] It's very much.
00:11:16 [W] So about the the people I think it's going to ring true as you as you view the talks across the week that the the contributors maintainers of the kubernetes project very deeply care about the
00:11:32 [W] The people who work on the project the people who consume what we produce every day.
00:11:40 [W] Now one of the interesting questions that was asked as we slow down the release Cadence The Slowdown of the release Cadence resulted in what will be only three releases for the
00:11:55 [W] For the 2020 calendar year and the question was?
00:12:00 [W] Is this permanent?
00:12:02 [W] Is that something that's going to continue to happen right now?
00:12:06 [W] We have a set of folks that are that are of differing opinions and I was interested in getting some feedback here and kind of coalescing all of that into one place now.
00:12:21 [W] Decided to do something incredibly scientific and I started a Twitter poll to ask would you prefer three releases are for for the year?
00:12:27 [W] And I got some great responses.
00:12:29 [W] I got some really really great responses some well-thought-out one some funny ones as well as offering options, like releasing releasing twice a year releasing once a year talking about LTS,
00:12:45 [W] On a nightly basis releasing on a weekly basis, right? So lots of different options to consider and layered onto those options is what is best for
00:12:57 [W] Unity what is best for the people who have to produce kubernative what is best for the people who are Downstream contributor contributors to Downstream projects?
00:13:05 [W] What are the what are the trade-offs for end user communities that need to consume kubernative?
00:13:14 [W] What are the trade-offs for vendors cloud cloud providers that are interested in consuming kubernative.
00:13:21 [W] Zar published distributions.
00:13:22 [W] s of kubernative
00:13:25 [W] Now I'm going to kind of rapid-fire some of the feedback that was given, but firstly I'll say that there was overwhelming support for three releases as opposed to four for the year.
00:13:40 [W] Now one of the things that I consider as as one of the co-chairs of Sig release is the overhead to actually crank the wheel that is that is kubernative, right?
00:13:55 [W] a a minor release of kubenetes and and part of that is is communication a huge part of that is communication usually affectionately call the the incoming release team lead the
00:14:09 [W] Cat herder of the group. The release team is a group of somewhere between at any one cycle 25 and 40 people and 40 people now all of those people
00:14:13 [W] one we have to recruit those people to all of those people are responsible for delivering delivering feedback from the various cigs sub-projects component areas
00:14:26 [W] It's back into Sig release so that we can get an accurate picture of what's happening for right now the quarter and and maybe maybe later something different in terms of cadence.
00:14:38 [W] So one of the big things I consider is is the overhead to actually spin up a team every cycle right that takes that takes at least two weeks if we're if we're doing it quickly and a little more
00:14:53 [W] Lee spin up a team every cycle right that takes that takes at least two weeks if we're if we're doing it quickly and a little more if we're considering holidays feedback
00:15:10 [W] Ring holidays feedback reaching out to people doing interviews.
00:15:15 [W] So on and so forth.
00:15:16 [W] So that's one component of it.
00:15:18 [W] The other another component is the release engineering tooling right? So some of the release engineering tooling that we use today has been in place from close to the Inception of the project, right?
00:15:32 [W] So considerations around how we build functionality into new sets of tools.
00:15:40 [W] And how we start to spin down the old right the goal being that the new tools are more sustainable more likely to have to attract contributors to our group.
00:15:54 [W] group. So on and so forth, right?
00:15:56 [W] So also considering data so Sig cluster lifecycle recently had a survey where the data does support that people would be interested in future releases now, why
00:16:12 [W] Polly to have to attract contributors to our group so on and so forth, right?
00:16:19 [W] So also considering data so Sig cluster lifecycle recently had a survey where the data does support that people would be interested in in future releases now, why
00:16:50 [W] I think I think kind of with the 2020 theme but also every other year people are struggling to keep up now as a former former field
00:17:05 [W] Architect at Cloud native leaders like Coral s and red hat. I've had the opportunity to see up close what users have to deal with as they consider moving to kubernative
00:17:20 [W] What users have to deal with as they consider moving to kubernative a sore upgrading kubernative A's and and the kind of the kind of work that's involved there from a company perspective.
00:17:33 [W] Of the kind of work that's involved there from a company perspective as well as the work that needs to not happen in order for that to happen moving moving
00:17:48 [W] As well as the work that needs to not happen in order for that to happen moving moving to New infrastructure means that you spend less time on building building for for stability.
00:18:03 [W] Means that you spend less time building and deploying features, right? So that's something to consider from the end user perspective as well.
00:18:11 [W] now
00:18:13 [W] For for users, at least one of those release cycles that we have for the year.
00:18:20 [W] Their focus is is you know is pointing somewhere else, right and it's as I mentioned whether it's delivering features delivering stability for their internal platforms applications and again something that
00:18:35 [W] To consider now something that I love that happened towards the end of the 119 really cycle is that we had an extended code freeze and we had an extended.
00:18:44 [W] hold on thawing in the code essentially making kubernative the kubernative kubernative repo ready to accept merges again, so we have various various tooling that allows us to
00:18:59 [W] To gate merges for on Milestones on whether or not something is approved on whether the tests are failing or not.
00:19:04 [W] And
00:19:05 [W] I saw the opportunity both from the Sig release side from the Sig testing side from a slew of of Sig chair component of project areas in
00:19:21 [W] Areas in improving the way that we test the infrastructure that we test upon and that was a net positive for the project.
00:19:29 [W] So being able to build stability and some more of the processes that we that we care about day to day that we have to kind of live through day-to-day is important as well.
00:19:43 [W] Now some some people brought up the fear of accumulating risk and Technical debt in the project and to be frank with you.
00:19:55 [W] We've already done it.
00:19:57 [W] We've already done it.
00:19:59 [W] We've already done it. So I think this is a good opportunity for us to step back.
00:20:03 [W] Look at open issues. Look at things that are in previous Milestones. Look at things that are targeted for targeted as priority important long-term.
00:20:14 [W] And and think about how to plan out those projects think about how to deliver enhancements in a more sustainable way, right?
00:20:25 [W] So Sig responsibilities things like the API policies the feature graduation changes making it possible for more people to consume kubernative A's releases whether they
00:20:40 [W] It possible for more people to consume kubernative A's releases whether they be pre-releases miners are seized the the patch releases that come out monthly all of that is kind of composed in this.
00:20:55 [W] Ori as well as driving down the the rush to review during code freeze testing very specific things more often and figuring out what all of the downstream implications are for
00:21:10 [W] You day to day so really in closing I would ask you to to be vocal about what you want as we consider changes to the release process have the conversation with us in slack on the
00:21:24 [W] Cross the cigs if you want to reach out via DM and chat about this feel free.
00:21:28 [W] Feel free to come to come to us because we want to make a decision and we want to make a decision considering everyone who's involved whether it be a contributor maintainer Downstream consumer end users Cloud providers.
00:21:42 [W] So come come come and play.
00:21:44 [W] Thank you for your time everyone. Have a good day.
00:21:50 [W] Awesome.
00:21:51 [W] Thank you Stephen.
00:21:52 [W] Let's give him a round of applause and the select Channel especially what I really like about Steven's talk, right?
00:21:58 [W] It's you know, it's an in response to the current times.
00:22:01 [W] Maybe it is a really good opportunity for all of us to reflect upon the you know, the pace of you're working on before covid before all these changes happen to our work life is that you know, maybe we were all burning the candle at both ends and we need you to find a way that's more sustainable.
00:22:17 [W] I really love this message now.
00:22:16 [W] Let's go on to our next set of speakers. Our next presenters are Guinevere Sanger.
00:22:23 [W] Oops.
00:22:23 [W] Sorry going to vary forgot to ask it how to pronounce your name beforehand and Leah Peterson Guinevere. The software engineer at GitHub and Leia is a reliability engineer at to Sigma Investments rating today.
00:22:35 [W] Apparently is very hard for me. Now today, they'll talk about the Ada developers Academy and the work the graduates do please welcome Guinevere and Leah.
00:22:55 [W] Hi everybody.
00:22:56 [W] Thank you for joining us today.
00:23:00 [W] So we're all here at Cube Kong to learn more about Cloud Technologies.
00:23:04 [W] If we could look around the room right now, we would see a huge group of people with different backgrounds and skills all leveraging Cloud Technologies for different reasons.
00:23:16 [W] In fact saying I guess we're all Cloud Engineers now has become a bit of a complaint throughout the industry.
00:23:25 [W] So today we want to talk about who are we building these Cloud Technologies for the computers to make them run faster to make them more reliable.
00:23:35 [W] Why are we doing this?
00:23:36 [W] In general depends on cloud computing more and more especially in these socially distant times.
00:23:36 [W] So as the definition of a cloud user expands we have to make sure we're building tools that help this diverse user base Leverage The Cloud.
00:23:50 [W] So how do we build great tools for a set of users who aren't like us?
00:23:57 [W] We work with a team of developers who aren't like us to build strong tools.
00:24:02 [W] We need engineering teams with many different skills backgrounds and perspectives.
00:24:10 [W] Let's take a look at some Cloud Engineers out there.
00:24:17 [W] Hi, I'm gonna be here as a musician.
00:24:20 [W] I learned to quickly recognize patterns, which now helps me to design and build intuitive to pulley tooling that is easy to use for every engineer at GitHub.
00:24:33 [W] Hello, my name is Leah.
00:24:36 [W] I bring several skills from my previous job as a motorcycle stunt Rider to my role as a reliability engineer today, including breaking down big and sometimes scary problems creating a plan and knowing when to just go for it
00:24:51 [W] Skills have helped me both learn how to do a wheelie and also migrate services to the cloud.
00:24:51 [W] We would also like to highlight two pain who uses her skills breaking down content to speak to people with different experience levels to help her build open source Cloud authentication tools.
00:25:07 [W] As a software engineer at hashicorp to who would support struggling teammates in a constructive way to help her team move forward and resolve conflict, which is a skill that she developed in her previous role managing students teachers and families in a business context.
00:25:24 [W] And finally, I'm only a musician turned software engineer who uses her skills from her eclectic background to build platforms that help Google Cloud users manage their billing and budgets.
00:25:36 [W] It's so what do all of these Engineers have in common you thought I was gonna say kubernative.
00:25:46 [W] It's didn't you in fact, it's that we all learned how to code and got jobs in the tech industry.
00:25:52 [W] Thanks to Ada developers Academy.
00:25:58 [W] Is a developers Academy is a non-profit tuition-free coding school in Seattle aimed at women and gender diverse adults and it has a great social justice mission.
00:26:10 [W] If you're interested in leveraging the Ada Network to bring different perspectives to your engineering team.
00:26:02 [W] There are a few ways you can get involved first. You can sponsor an intern or you could consider hiring a graduate from our ever growing pool of graduates from the Boot Camp or you could support or attend our
00:26:17 [W] I'm conference, which is called a t-con and you can get more information about that at a deacon.com.
00:26:12 [W] So to wrap this up while maybe not everyone is a cloud engineer.
00:26:18 [W] Everyone is in fact a cloud user.
00:26:21 [W] And with that we can say that to keep Cloud native everywhere.
00:26:26 [W] We must work with Engineers that do in fact come from everywhere.
00:26:33 [W] Thank you.
00:26:34 [W] Thank you.
00:26:39 [W] Thank you. Gwen and Leah right like we all especially I got the chance to work with go ahead and lay up for the presentation and you know, it is very true that different backgrounds provide so much more
00:26:54 [W] You know like the interaction right like that.
00:26:53 [W] You learn all these different set of questions to ask and you bring them to your community.
00:26:56 [W] And so it is really wonderful what it is doing and encourage everyone to look into it. Now the next keynote is very exciting Steve for everyone. Mostly because this is the first time we're doing a panel
00:27:11 [W] And so I want to welcome for lovely humans.
00:27:00 [W] Now this consists and there are circuity subject matter experts in cold water Duffy coolly bread Jessamine and Rory McCune Ian is a kubernative Sig co-chair and cncf Ambassador
00:27:15 [W] Hacking and Harden kubernative containers and cloudevents structure.
00:27:17 [W] Duffy is a Solutions architect at Apple.
00:27:20 [W] Brad is co-founder of dark bit and Rory is principal consultant at NC cgroup and a few weeks ago.
00:27:28 [W] They requested questions from the community centered around security and hacking and their unofficial special interest group Sig honk now instead of a normal clap.
00:27:40 [W] I encourage everyone to use the good old Goose. So
00:27:43 [W] please welcome Ian Duffy Brad and Rory with a good old round of goosing in the slack Channel.
00:28:15 [W] Hi, everybody greetings from Sunny Minneapolis where it is just as cold and snowy as it would be in Boston if we were all in the same place, welcome to the Sig honk ask us anything panel at coupon North America 2020 virtual
00:28:31 [W] Official kubernative special interest group.
00:28:25 [W] We are a hacker crew and a group of friends who have been working on various aspects of kubernative security for a long time now and we're super excited to be here. These questions have been brought To Us by the community and thank you all for submitting them.
00:28:36 [W] So thanks for being here with us.
00:28:38 [W] Let's introduce ourselves.
00:28:40 [W] My name is Ian cold water.
00:28:42 [W] I come from a devops turned pentesting background.
00:28:45 [W] I am now the co-chair of kubernative Sig security and the new director of Dessa cups at twilio. I've been hacking on kublr.
00:28:53 [W] Genetics things for about four years now, and I'm super excited to be here.
00:28:58 [W] Hey everyone.
00:28:59 [W] My name is Duffy coolly, and my pronouns are he/him.
00:29:03 [W] I've been playing with networks distributed systems and people in this space for quite a while and I really enjoy making in communities like kubernative like more approachable and and certainly more inclusive. So if you have any questions or anything I can ever do to help just
00:29:19 [W] I'm super excited to be here.
00:29:11 [W] Hey everyone.
00:29:12 [W] My name is Duffy coolly, and my pronouns are he/him.
00:29:16 [W] I've been playing with networks distributed systems and people in this space for quite a while and I really enjoy making in communities like kubernative like more approachable and and certainly more inclusive.
00:29:28 [W] So if you have any questions or anything I can ever do to help just reach out.
00:29:31 [W] I'm happy to do it.
00:29:32 [W] I've recently transitioned to Apple and and now I'm doing some of that work there. So I'm really excited to be here.
00:29:39 [W] Oh my pronouns, are they them to hi everyone. So, my name is Remi.
00:29:43 [W] Kin. My poor nouns are he/him.
00:29:45 [W] I'm a principal consultant at NCI cgroup where I focus mainly on doing security tests and assessments for customers and I be looking containerd security data for about four five years.
00:29:56 [W] I'm Brad giesemann. My pronouns are he/him.
00:29:59 [W] And I'm the co-founder of dark pit a consultancy focused on cloud and kubernetes security posture assessments.
00:30:05 [W] I've been building you hacking on kubernative for almost four years now as well.
00:30:09 [W] And yes, gieselmann is my real last name, but it's no coincidence that I was pretty much born a hunk speaking of that though.
00:30:16 [W] I suppose we should explain what all the honking is about. So the honk thing came from a video game called Untitled Goose game, which was published by a company called house house about a year ago.
00:30:26 [W] In time on total Goose game. The protagonist is a mischievous goose who runs around a pastoral English Village causing trouble on purpose this goose in this game kind of sneaks around and uses seemingly innocuous everyday
00:30:42 [W] Assessments I've been building in hacking on kubernative for almost four years now as well.
00:30:46 [W] yes, gieselmann is my real last name, but it's no coincidence that I was pretty much born honk speaking of that though. I suppose we should explain what all the honking is about.
00:30:57 [W] So the honk thing came from a video game called Untitled Goose game, which was published by a company called house house about a year ago entitled Goose game. The protagonist is a mischievous goose who runs around a pastoral English Village causing trouble on purpose
00:31:46 [W] to chain them together to perhaps do something like exploit them for its own ends because of this because it's kind of like the way hackers do things some of us hackers kind of adopted this Goose as a mascot of sorts and when we talk about honking a lot of the time
00:32:01 [W] About hacking or just causing problems on purpose.
00:32:04 [W] I have a question for you all so we've all been working on kubernative for a minute.
00:32:10 [W] How do you think that the security posture and attack surface has changed with more modern Cloud native text acts over the old way of doing things.
00:32:18 [W] That's a great question.
00:32:21 [W] I think you know in my mind the old way was when we would rack up a thousand servers or start up a bunch of virtual machines, and then we would leverage tools to deploy some subset of our application to
00:32:31 [W] A subset of those nodes, right?
00:32:33 [W] And and with that old way we had all kinds of interesting challenges like, you know shared libraries and other problems that would that would be inherent when we were trying to couple different applications on two particular nodes and the new way, we we're dealing with containerd
00:32:48 [W] In with a very similar model in which we're dropping applications on to some subset of those nodes or running them as long time or long running processes just like we did before but the difference is that now, you know where some of the benefits of this new
00:33:03 [W] Come into play is that now we're actually giving each of those running processes their own view of the network their own view of the filesystem their own view of the pit namespace and these things mean that we actually have better
00:33:12 [W] Says because we can actually containerize them.
00:33:14 [W] This is effectively what container Rising is is basically just giving that running process its own isolated view of the world.
00:33:23 [W] And so I do think that that has improved security but it hasn't changed a too much as we look at the way that those processes interact with the colonel.
00:33:32 [W] Yeah, I think for me one of the big things about moving to communities and Cloud native has been this move to automation is beating this process of everything being, you know, automated and and infrastructure as code and that's kind of got trade-offs.
00:33:45 [W] It's got good things for security and it's got some things that are challenges.
00:33:48 [W] the good things for me. One of the big ones is about repeatability this idea that you know, I can take this code and I can create you know, 10 20 30 environments I want from you is a security test. It means I can say hey spin me up a new environment just for my test.
00:34:02 [W] And I can be confident that my findings, you know, they're going to be relevant in the same ones as you're going to see in production.
00:34:07 [W] So that's great.
00:34:08 [W] But the downside is that we have to think about things differently now, so we don't have pets servers anymore.
00:34:13 [W] We can't just load all our secrets up manually. We have to work out how we're going to store them and how we're going to manage them securely and that's one of the problems the new problems that we have to think about and also with everything being in the cloud, you know, we have to think well, everything's exposed.
00:34:26 [W] Everything is one step away from being compromised. So we have to be really careful with how we manage our information and access to things.
00:34:32 [W] Because it's all out there just sitting on the cloud.
00:34:34 [W] Being in the cloud, you know, we have to think well, everything's exposed.
00:34:33 [W] Everything is one step away from being compromised.
00:34:35 [W] So it'd be really careful with how we manage our information and access to things because it's all out there just sitting on the cloud.
00:34:42 [W] Yeah, I think there are a lot of benefits.
00:34:45 [W] I mean the moved in API driven infrastructure and configuration means that there's so many more opportunities to bake security improvements into the code.
00:34:54 [W] That is the source of Truth as opposed to say only being able to bolt it on later and those same apis make it much easier to query about those security settings at scale one, you know one place you clear everything you can see what the actual answer is,
00:35:09 [W] of a security policy or Miss configuration its present is probably present everywhere that makes it much easier to fix because it's all on a central spot and you can have it reliably take effect on the whole Fleet and that brings a lot less overall toil but
00:35:24 [W] The challenge is is finding that balance of velocity on automation versus complexity and security.
00:35:32 [W] So another question that we got asked is what are we think developers of upstream and downstream cloudevents ology should be thinking about from a security perspective.
00:35:43 [W] So as you all said a minute ago, I mean it's important to just notes in general for people who are building this kind of infrastructure.
00:35:51 [W] That what's old is new again, you know that a lot of these problems of like the old Tech that the shiny Cloud native wrapper is around haven't really quite been solved yet.
00:35:59 [W] So keep an eye on those but also you can't just assume that everything is the same. So keep an eye on that too. If you're building your first party data center in the cloud.
00:36:06 [W] It's probably going to be very expensive and not work exactly the way you think it will but also in general when you're looking at the systems that you
00:36:14 [W] I think it's really important to look at it from the perspective of an attacker because as an attacker, I'm going to be looking at your systems and I'm going to be looking at them in perhaps a different way than you might do.
00:36:25 [W] You actually know what's running in your environment.
00:36:28 [W] Do you actually know exactly what your code does and if you do know what your code does are you including the perspective of an attacker Persona in your user personas if you use those because when I'm looking at a system, I'm looking at it for things like where are the holes in?
00:36:43 [W] In this where are the trust boundaries?
00:36:45 [W] Room when you're building them and think about how an attacker might look at them and what that perspective might look like that can be really valuable and threat model accordingly because having a threat model is really important.
00:36:55 [W] Yeah, I like that and I will paraphrase another friend who says that one of the ways to think about, you know, increasing the security of your of your application or your environment is to think about what tools you might be leaving behind for those attackers
00:37:11 [W] I'd be leaving behind for those attackers and and one of the ways that I conceptualize this is by thinking about like what is packaged inside of a container image right that can't that whole container images going to ship and it's going to be running and it's going to be exposed to that long-running
00:37:19 [W] We're talking about earlier. Right and that means that anything that's inside of that container image will be available. If somebody were to get a reverse shell on that note now.
00:37:27 [W] I understand like the incredible power of having a debugging tool or bash or you know, SCP or any of these amazing tools that you could use to actually like get logs off of the running out of a container or understand what's
00:37:42 [W] Regular process or debugging things but at the same time and and many people actually will bundle these things into their container image because it might be come in handy later.
00:37:51 [W] But at the same time it may not come in handy for you and it may come and come in handy for anybody like even people who have or are working for Anna Faris purposes.
00:38:00 [W] The other thing I think that is useful is talking about these new containerd, you know, this container orchestration model we have to think about like, you know, what privilege has been granted to that process right like
00:38:12 [W] Is it running as a privilege container?
00:38:14 [W] Can it see all of the pins in the host name space?
00:38:17 [W] is it able to manipulate network interfaces? Is it able to do things like this and there's a ton of sharp edges and configurability in this especially with regard to things like kubernative.
00:38:27 [W] But yeah, you know what tools have you left behind? What have you left behind for your attackers is a great way to think about this.
00:38:34 [W] Another great question that came up for us was how do you go about evaluating the attack surface of a cluster on actually attacking it? Like where where do you even begin?
00:38:45 [W] Yeah, that's a really good one.
00:38:47 [W] So for me a lot of what I do focuses on things from a configuration standpoint. So I'll first look at the configuration of the external network and how access to the control plane in the nodes or configure and I'll kind of work my way in and I'll look at the configuration of
00:39:02 [W] environment like say how the cluster situated and what axis it has to other things and then I'm thinking about like the API server and just ruling out the obvious are back flaws like Anonymous secrets to you know access to Secrets or if there's any applicable see bees
00:39:15 [W] And it's sort of like stepping in further kind of like layers of the onion.
00:39:08 [W] I look at the configuration of the kubernative components the cloud credentials that are attached to the worker nodes and then sort of as a unit the combination of our back admission control network access control and container image
00:39:23 [W] And then sort of as a unit the combination of our back admission control network access control and container image contents kind of all is one thing to say, you know, what's the overall security posture of that giving workloads?
00:39:50 [W] that perspective
00:39:52 [W] Yeah, I think that ties a lot of with what we end up doing.
00:39:55 [W] I think when we end up doing security systems for customers, but we typically do is we'll take one of two approaches, you know, will either take this white box approach where we cannot give it access, you know will give it access to comb faced were given access to pull stuff down and they are a lot of what turns out to be happening is we end up doing
00:40:10 [W] Have two approaches, you know, well either take this white box approach where we cannot give an access, you know, we're giving access to calm things were given access to pull stuff down and they are a lot of what turns out to be happening is we end up doing data analysis building large quantities of Json down and parsing it and looking
00:40:25 [W] Sundowning parsing it and looking for patterns, you know, you got a lot of data to look at Automation and parsing is really important and you're looking for patterns that could indicate problems so could be cluster. Admin, you know, this this process runs is class for up and that's going to be dangerous.
00:40:39 [W] It's all going to be a target for me or other attackers.
00:40:41 [W] What about privilege containers is Duffy said before privilege containers can see all the processes they can get a lot more access.
00:40:47 [W] So what's in there that might be running is privileged. But then when we're doing the Black Box what we're doing is really trying to take that scenario and say Hey, you know, hey.
00:40:54 [W] Hey, I am a compromise container. You know, I've got access to this container.
00:40:59 [W] What can I do?
00:40:59 [W] Can I break out the sandbox?
00:41:01 [W] What rights do I have do I maybe have a dock or socket mounted inside my container and maybe where can I go on the network? So these two approaches but you're looking to the same kind of thing. You're looking for patterns of Badness?
00:41:12 [W] Yeah, totally what they said, you know, you want to look at like what exactly is going on in the environment that you're assessing like what's running in there? How is it running what level of privilege does it have?
00:41:24 [W] Is there anything that is potentially exploitable and then if you can get that then you kind of see how far you can go.
00:41:32 [W] Can you break out of the container?
00:41:33 [W] Can you break out of the node?
00:41:36 [W] Can you break out of the cluster itself and go into the cloud? It's really going to vary depending on what?
00:41:41 [W] You find but it's really a matter of like figuring out what's going on.
00:41:45 [W] Seeing how far you can get and a lot of it as y'all said is pattern recognition, but I want to note that if people are watching this who are new to this.
00:41:53 [W] Of us using a lot of pattern recognition to be discouraging to you because this isn't Magic.
00:41:58 [W] It isn't that where like Wizards who have Arcane knowledge that cannot be gained by other people.
00:42:03 [W] It's just that we've had a lot of practice and that's something that you can learn and practice to and for people who are excited about learning how to attack kubernative and this kind of thing.
00:42:11 [W] I want to encourage you to get your hands dirty go in and start practicing how to do that yourself a couple of great resources to do that are there's a workshop that happened at kubeacademy.
00:42:22 [W] Kane last year by Brad and some other awesome flux. You can find it at secure kubernative.com.
00:42:27 [W] It holds up very well with time and you can go all the way through it.
00:42:30 [W] There's also a CTF that happens periodically called honks ETL at one point.
00:42:34 [W] We played it as a team and it was pretty great and I believe that we want it.
00:42:37 [W] And so that's something to look out for and in general playing Capture the Flag games like ctfs not the kind of capture the flag that you played on the playground when you were a kid, but the kind that's like getting to like learn how to hack and sharpen your skills and learn
00:42:52 [W] To think like an attacker is something I really recommend that people do because it can be useful and it's also fun while we're on the subject of pattern recognition.
00:43:02 [W] Another question that we got that I'm going to throw to you. All is if somebody is a defender or a cluster administrator, what are some indicators that a cluster or kubernative environment has been compromised that people should look out for if there's a breach
00:43:17 [W] Is there something that people can see that happened?
00:43:22 [W] Yeah, you know going back to the answer about like how the kubernative security surface has changed.
00:43:29 [W] I think it actually highlights, you know, some of the complexity that we've introduced in this process as well.
00:43:33 [W] So let's think about like the old way and the new way and glue these things together.
00:43:37 [W] So the old way we would have, you know, a subset of our applications running on a subset of nodes and we might configure something like audit D to watch for behavior that we thought was not was not normal right and alert on that and then that would give us the ability to kind of understand that things were
00:43:52 [W] putting in our systems that we're not at that we were not expecting something you might not be expecting is something modifying or opening the file at the password right or the shadow file or any or other like secure, you know things that you would expect that
00:44:07 [W] Not an application would not do during normal experience.
00:44:12 [W] Well now in this new system as we as we described as we explore containerization, we have n number of etsy password files, right because each process has its own file system, right?
00:44:24 [W] And so that definitely adds a bit of complexity to the problem because now we actually have to understand, you know, which password file was attract or it was touched and which container was it running and is that still not normal?
00:44:37 [W] Allure is that okay, right, but understanding that normal behavior and like understanding how to do to detect it has changed. We can't just watch all of the file systems.
00:44:48 [W] We have to change the way we're watching for those things.
00:44:50 [W] There's a great project in the cncf umbrella called Falco and Falco basically operates at the syscall interface.
00:44:57 [W] so it's watching for system calls like file open or a grabbing a file handle on Etsy password against the Linux kernel
00:45:07 [W] And then maintaining the context so that you can understand which containerd has happened in and maintaining the context you can understand which container opened that Network socket and and really provides like a great Next Generation Oddity capability. So
00:45:22 [W] That's definitely how I would start.
00:45:25 [W] Yeah, I'll go with Duffy said about you know, getting visibility into what's happening inside. The containers for that malicious activity is like the primary source, like somebody could control exact or a shell was spawned, you know file connection like tough. He said
00:45:40 [W] Early indicators.
00:45:42 [W] I think the next best place to be looking are the audit logs.
00:45:45 [W] So, you know the API server audit logs and the neighboring Cloud API audit logs are really key in terms of getting that clear Smoking Gun evidence and while it might not be the first thing that captures the compromise.
00:46:00 [W] Probably going to capture a lot of the next steps that the attacker will take because they will most likely find valid credentials somewhere and try those credentials against those apis as they say, you know, can I expand my access inside the cluster
00:46:15 [W] Her privileged escalate or try to escape out into the nose or Escape out into the neighboring Cloud environment.
00:46:21 [W] for me, I think the one-two punch is is malicious activity detection logs and the audit logs in combination so you can really understand what just happened.
00:46:33 [W] So hopefully security incidents like that will continue to be relatively uncommon but one of the questions that might be helpful for cluster administrators to know more about is you know, how do you go about evaluating a project for its overall
00:46:48 [W] Security posture before you take the time to install it and integrate it into your own environment. Like what things are you looking for? And that'll throw that over to you guys?
00:46:58 [W] Yeah, that's a really great question.
00:46:59 [W] And I think obviously there are a huge number of projects in this space.
00:47:02 [W] So it's one you're going to have to spend some time on the first place. I would probably Luke is, you know the cncf security order, of course, you know, every graduated project has gotten older report on by third party. Those are great resources not just for like looking at code bugs, but also for looking at how the project you know, how
00:47:17 [W] What is security posture is like so that's a good starting point.
00:47:21 [W] I'll also tend to look at the websites, you know for each project and say do you have Security contact information, you know, do you are you encouraging secure to be able to get in touch and actually like get involved with the project and then the other place I tend to look is what's the happy path install like
00:47:36 [W] Of faults this project uses.
00:47:38 [W] Are they going to give you a secure installation?
00:47:39 [W] Because that's not tends to be two good indicator as well.
00:47:44 [W] For me, I want to know how exactly the thing works like technically.
00:47:49 [W] What are the details of like what exactly is it doing in there?
00:47:53 [W] What kind of privilege does it ask for?
00:47:55 [W] What kind of access does it need?
00:47:57 [W] Does it have readwrite access to the host to other machines like as an attacker?
00:48:04 [W] I know how I would want to potentially use something to break out of it.
00:48:07 [W] How viable is that? And in general if I'm using it from thinking about using it in my environment? How does it fit into my environment?
00:48:14 [W] What does it require to be connected to does it conflict with anything?
00:48:17 [W] And you know, what does it talk to and how does it fit into my threat model?
00:48:22 [W] Because it's really important as I said earlier to threat model your environment figure out what's in their figure out what's important to you and see if that project is going to fit into that larger goal.
00:48:34 [W] So I have a question for you. All speaking of larger goals.
00:48:37 [W] How do you find inspiration for where to honk next and how do you develop intuition about the emergent behavior of complex systems?
00:48:44 [W] I really like this question.
00:48:45 [W] I think it's fun.
00:48:45 [W] Yeah.
00:48:47 [W] it's a great question.
00:48:48 [W] I for my part.
00:48:49 [W] I think it's a I really maintain curiosity about everything the everything around me all the time.
00:48:55 [W] I'm done.
00:48:56 [W] I'm definitely one of those questioned everything types of people and I find that that's true.
00:49:03 [W] Not just in the way that I evaluate software or the video I evaluate systems but generally in life like I would look at an elevator and realize I'm going to be on this elevator, you know for 20 minutes of my day every day.
00:49:14 [W] So I wonder what else I can learn about this elevator right and might do this research on the type of elevator it is and see if there are any like, you know secret button pushes or tricks to actually opted to change.
00:49:25 [W] the behavior of this elevator into my benefit right like and so for my part, it's definitely curiosity stay curious, you know, like under, you know, take the time to explore that Curiosity and I know that we can all feel very rushed
00:49:40 [W] When we're doing our day-to-day job, but like that Curiosity and you should be celebrated and you know, take some time to maintain that.
00:49:49 [W] Absolutely, I think curiosity is a big part of it and for me like some of the best places I get kind of inspiration is from trying to answer people's questions, you know, seeing someone asked me a simple question go.
00:49:59 [W] That's a good point.
00:50:00 [W] How does that work?
00:50:01 [W] It's one of the things I do is I do a training course on containerd security and definitely some of my best inspiration has come from a question on that core say hey, how does that work?
00:50:09 [W] Oh that leaves me down a path and you know, there's other places places. Well, you know, you can go to stack Overflow or security stack exchange and try and answer the questions and doing that.
00:50:19 [W] Will lead you to interesting places could even lead to see these the other one.
00:50:23 [W] one. I like personally is I got to get a big issues right go to kubernative issues list filter by security just start reading the issues finding out what people are thinking about security and again that can lead to interesting places or even see these
00:50:36 [W] I'm also a big fan of reading GitHub issues and not just in the kubernative repository various kinds of dependencies different kinds of third-party components can have interesting questions that are positive there too because not everybody necessarily
00:50:51 [W] Looks like a security bug but often other bugs can be security bugs.
00:50:55 [W] So sometimes if you read between the lines in different kinds of issues of people being like I found this weird problem, what's up with that?
00:51:01 [W] Sometimes you can find interesting things there.
00:51:03 [W] I also really enjoyed reading the docks.
00:51:05 [W] A lot of project documentation can have interesting phrases in it. Like this can provoke unexpected Behavior.
00:51:12 [W] Do not use this in production.
00:51:13 [W] Please make sure to change these insecure defaults and things like that that when I see that I'm like that's interesting.
00:51:20 [W] NG what does this mean?
00:51:22 [W] And then I want to go Jason and poke at it inspiration can be found from all kinds of places. And personally, I'm excited about that unexpected behavior and those intersections and Corner cases of like what you don't think you're going to find but do so.
00:51:35 [W] Those are a lot of the time the things that I look for.
00:51:39 [W] Yeah curiosity.
00:51:40 [W] Definitely.
00:51:41 [W] I'm fortunate in that I always get to see a fair number of different setups and there's always something I haven't seen before. So I like to use that opportunity to get my hands on it. I have to see it running get it working and then sort
00:51:57 [W] Take survey of what it needs is the assumptions and design decisions that were made especially around those defaults. But I don't like sobbing there. You know, that might be you know job done, but that's where I think the fun just starts so I go right it poking and prodding.
00:52:12 [W] Trying to knock it over mess with its inputs and really see how it handles things when I'm really giving it things that it wasn't expecting. So all the time asking what if I do this what if I do that what if I give it that too much too little if I take that out like what
00:52:27 [W] Savior emerges so like a few months ago.
00:52:29 [W] I was poking at a container image manifest.
00:52:31 [W] Let's just take it out the digester like modifying the URL to fetch a layer from somewhere else and that just ended up triggering a CV in a container runtime.
00:52:40 [W] you know things like that that just kind of pop out of that immersion behavior is really where I like to go to dive in and get my hands dirty on.
00:52:48 [W] So we all have unique takes on how we find new things. But like what's an area that you all think is right for further hacking and exportation.
00:52:58 [W] Yeah, you know I think going back to like how we're changing things, you know, like how things are changed under containerd containerd orchestration.
00:53:04 [W] There is a ton of space that we haven't really spent a ton of time with yet. Right as we think about the way that we're building that isolation model, you know giving each process its own network news Pace or file system those sorts of things.
00:53:17 [W] This is actually implemented by container runtimes and there are several popular container runtimes that makes you wonder like are they all operating the same?
00:53:27 [W] Were they all designed with the same set of assumptions?
00:53:30 [W] I think if there's like a pretty rich space in those sorts of assumptions also things like system calls, right?
00:53:39 [W] Like I was talking about earlier with Falco watching at the Cisco layer to understand what's happening.
00:53:44 [W] The mapping of syscalls is different on the based on the architecture that you use so it would be different for x86 64 then it would be forearm and and I do think that like, you know in those models where we like make the assumption that perhaps we should be only operating under the
00:53:59 [W] Up.
00:53:59 [W] That's under x6c.
00:54:01 [W] x86 64 but this is now running on arm. So is it you know, are we still are we seeing a difference in Behavior those sorts of assumptions?
00:54:09 [W] I think really definitely highlight, you know a whole field of area the play with
00:54:15 [W] I think for me is all about these layers and all the different assumptions are being built up as we stopped over more and more layers, you know from the colonel up through Docker through kubenetes into things like servicemeshcon where those layers meet you get these kind of possibilities for
00:54:30 [W] you're sharp edges Corner cases stuff that could be followed and we're implementing a lot of protocols that are historically complicated things like HTTP, they're being security bugs of HTTP servers for decades now and also pki, you know kubernative makes a lot of
00:54:45 [W] CPI is traditionally a complex thing that has had a lot of security issues.
00:54:48 [W] So those are the kind of areas.
00:54:50 [W] I think are good in particular.
00:54:52 [W] I think where we ever see a new layer. So every new layer has a time to settle down and to work out what security looks like.
00:54:58 [W] So at the moment something like operators, you know, it's quite a new thing.
00:55:01 [W] It's there's a lot of activity there is a lot of development. So there's probably going to be opportunities to you know to poke at it some more and it's an area.
00:55:08 [W] think I'm probably more interested, you know over the next 12 months or so.
00:55:12 [W] Yeah for me. I've noticed a growing number of projects that are extending the kubernative API with custom resources. And that's to do things like create more clusters and even as like a new abstraction for managing other Cloud resources, and I think
00:55:28 [W] Anytime you give the data plane of one environment enough access and permissions to be the control plane of another environment.
00:55:35 [W] I think that's where things can really get interesting when those those layers intersect.
00:55:41 [W] Pressure and yeah, continuing the ongoing theme of layers, you know containers security is a holistic thing, right? Your container security is only as good as the security of the rest of your stack and for me thinking about the way that the
00:55:56 [W] Front parts of the stack cataract present a lot of exciting often unexplored attack surface.
00:56:00 [W] I'm really excited about Hardware attacks. I think Michael architectural techs are really interesting like meltdown inspector and their variants and I think that there is a lot of unexplored territory about how that can interact with things like multi-tenancy in the cloud.
00:56:14 [W] I'm also really excited one layer above about EPF as an attack surface.
00:56:20 [W] think that that is a very interesting unexplored territory where there's a lot of fun things that we haven't quite done yet.
00:56:25 [W] Yet so I feel excited about exploring that coming up and and just getting to explore all of the things because I think the cloud native space in general is so new.
00:56:38 [W] We're all exploring and building this stuff together.
00:56:40 [W] There's parts of the attack surface.
00:56:41 [W] We don't even know are there yet Perhaps because it hasn't been invented.
00:56:45 [W] So I'm super excited to be here at coupon Cloud knative con with everybody getting to build this future together and these Technologies together and I want to say thank you to all of you for
00:56:56 [W] Being here in building and exploring these features with us. If you want to be further involved in the kubernative project or the security of it.
00:57:06 [W] there's lots of work in kubernative to do and in the cncf landscape in general kubernative and a lot of these projects are open source.
00:57:13 [W] there's lots of work to be done. Lots of interesting problems to solve if you want to get involved kubernative has lots of special interest groups Sig's that do lots of different kinds of work.
00:57:23 [W] I'm the co-chair of security.
00:57:25 [W] We have lots of interesting problems to solve and we would love for you to get further involved. If you're interested. If you want to ask us questions or talk to us further, we're around you can find us on kubernative slack or discuss that k8s dot IO and we would love to be able to talk to you all and
00:57:41 [W] We're in a few together.
00:57:43 [W] Indeed and I also wanted to highlight again that like a lot of the questions that we answered during this am a panel came from the community and I wanted to give a shout out to everybody in the community who took the time to ask us your questions for this panel.
00:57:56 [W] We could not do this without your help.
00:57:59 [W] So thank you so much for putting up questions.
00:58:03 [W] And one more thing called the pilot Planet.
00:58:17 [W] Well, thank you Honker.
00:58:19 [W] I just thought the proper terminology.
00:58:20 [W] Thank you panel.
00:58:23 [W] I hope everyone will can't slack everyone seems to be really enjoying this panels of don't forget to else give this feedback on the content on the format. We really want to hear it's a sport for everyone.
00:58:33 [W] And also thank yous panel speakers those amazing amount of work of preparation and amazing delivery now for our next speakers.
00:58:40 [W] I want to introduce grad Shipley and Marissa Bush Grant is a senior director of developer experience at VMware. And Marissa is a program lead for the kubeacademy at VMware today.
00:58:52 [W] They will highlight how the community can advance knowledge of kubernative from getting started use cases all the way to Advanced deployments. Please welcome Grant and Marissa.
00:59:13 [W] Hello everyone.
00:59:14 [W] My name is Grant Shipley and I'm a senior director at VMware focused on kubernative as I'm down in my basement recording this short little keynote presentation.
00:59:24 [W] My kids are upstairs doing what most kids are doing today and that's online learning and that's what I'm here to talk to you about today. But let's start with the numbers now five years.
00:59:34 [W] Ago was the first-ever cube Khan and I was fortunate enough to be able to attend it during that conference.
00:59:40 [W] We had 510 attendees.
00:59:42 [W] Let's fast forward to 2020 to this specific event, and we have over 25,000 people registered and attending Cube con this year.
00:59:54 [W] We have been moving extremely fast during the last five years kubenetes has been adopted as the default platform for cloud native applications going forward and if you believe some of the numbers and analysts this was according to the IDC
01:00:09 [W] Future scape survey 500 million new applications will be developed over the next five years that is more than the last 40 years combined now the challenge with that though.
01:00:22 [W] is that according to stack overflows recent state of development survey 42% of all developers have less than five years of experience.
01:00:32 [W] so we need to be able to ensure that we embracing these new people into the community as they come up to speed.
01:00:39 [W] Don kubernative and that we have the tools and knowledge to be successful now VMware, we have a lot of kubernative.
01:01:09 [W] Turn it over to Marissa who's going to update you on some of the work that we have going on right now at VMware.
01:01:16 [W] Thanks Grant on the topic of making online learning better.
01:01:20 [W] I want to highlight kubeacademy.
01:01:21 [W] kubeacademy offers free online kubenetes training anyone can go to kubeacademy.com to take courses designed and delivered by experts. The course library is always expanding but right now we have 20 courses and more hours of training.
01:01:37 [W] Then the entire series of schitt's Creek.
01:01:41 [W] To give you a taste for the courses.
01:01:43 [W] Here's a great starting point for beginners.
01:01:45 [W] If you're new to kubernative East we recommend taking these three courses in order to help build your foundational knowledge.
01:01:53 [W] For those of you with a more intermediate skill level we have courses that will help get you ready for the CK exam.
01:01:59 [W] Of course that will walk you through options to get observability and your applications and systems. Of course that dives into kubenetes object types and many more
01:02:11 [W] We even have courses for experts to you can dive into the world of networking to understand the kubernative network model learn the design principles and components of the kubernative machine and get Hands-On with command line operations for Kube cuddle.
01:02:27 [W] You can even sign up for kubeacademy Pro for free to get interact to get access to interactive workshops and more in-depth content.
01:02:37 [W] These courses are led by the same individuals that are contributing to kubenetes and related open source projects.
01:02:43 [W] They're sharing what they've learned from hundreds of kubenetes deployments.
01:02:47 [W] And of course, they're creating these trainings for you.
01:02:49 [W] So they're always curious to hear which topics you would like them to cover next.
01:02:55 [W] If you're looking to contribute your own knowledge, you can join the faculty use this QR code to access an application form to become a cube Academy instructor.
01:03:07 [W] So if you're looking to advance your knowledge of kubenetes, you can go to kubeacademy.com today to start your first course.
01:03:17 [W] This can be any continues to lift each other up and sharing our knowledge is part of how we drive Kuma nineties and the cloud native ecosystem forward.
01:03:26 [W] And with that, thank you so much and enjoy the rest of Uconn.
01:03:35 [W] Thank you. Grant and Marissa, I think arguably the probably isn't such a thing as too little s**** Creek at least, you know, Nancy Stephen are pretty biased towards that but thank you for sharing that.
01:03:49 [W] Okay. Kubeacademy sounds really wonderful now our next presenter she'll is very familiar to all of you Liz rice Liz is a cncf Toc chair and vice president of open-source engineering at Aqua Security today.
01:04:03 [W] Give an update on the cloud native communities progress and where we might go from here for the per second perspective of the technical oversight committee Toc please welcome Liz rice.
01:04:33 [W] Hi, my name is Liz Wright, and I'm the chair of the cncf technical oversight committee.
01:04:40 [W] We're the group that steer the technical direction of the foundation and assess projects that apply to join or move up through sandbox and incubation to graduated level.
01:04:53 [W] This gives us a vantage point to see interesting Trends emerging from the cloud native world.
01:05:01 [W] So I want to take a few minutes today to talk about some of the changes. We want to focus on over the next year or so and share some predictions about the up-and-coming technology areas.
01:05:13 [W] We think will get more attention in 2021 and Beyond.
01:05:20 [W] This year we revamp the sandbox process making it much easier for projects to join at that level.
01:05:27 [W] But with the understanding that this is a space for experimentation and early stage collaboration.
01:05:34 [W] So here's our first prediction for 2021.
01:05:38 [W] We expect to see some sandbox projects failing and others consolidating or merging with other projects. This is an entirely healthy thing.
01:05:50 [W] If the cncf is going to support and encourage innovation in the cloud knative space, we have to expect some of the experiments to fail.
01:05:58 [W] Upon coming technology areas.
01:06:00 [W] we think will get more attention in 2021 and Beyond.
01:06:07 [W] This year we revamp the sandbox process making it much easier for projects to join at that level.
01:06:14 [W] But with the understanding that this is a space for experimentation and early stage collaboration.
01:06:22 [W] So here's our first prediction for 2021.
01:06:25 [W] We expect to see some sandbox projects failing and others consolidating or merging with other projects. This is an entirely healthy thing.
01:06:37 [W] If the cncf is going to support and encourage innovation in the cloud native space, we have to expect some of these experiments to fail.
01:06:45 [W] In fact, if all our sandbox projects make it to incubation that would suggest we haven't been experimental enough.
01:06:53 [W] Let's keep Cloud native innovative.
01:06:58 [W] At the other end of the maturity spectrum is graduation.
01:07:02 [W] A graduated project is one that we believe is ready for widespread adoption with little risk to an Enterprise that chooses to take it on.
01:07:14 [W] The current graduation criteria were drawn up at a time when moving to Cloud knative was a pretty cutting-edge thing for an Enterprise to do now we're seeing much wider adoption and we have many more
01:08:01 [W] knative innovative
01:08:04 [W] at the other end of the maturity spectrum is graduation.
01:08:08 [W] I graduated project is one that we believe is ready for widespread adoption with little risk to an Enterprise that chooses to take it on.
01:08:20 [W] The current graduation criteria were drawn up at a time when moving to Cloud knative was a pretty cutting-edge thing for an Enterprise to do now we're seeing much wider adoption and we have many more
01:08:35 [W] Sense for the TOC to take a look at the way we assess projects at incubation and graduation to make sure these definitions stay meaningful for everyone.
01:08:46 [W] We're absolutely sticking with the principles of no King makers and one size does not fit all but we think that as a community we can do an even better job of highlighting the best Solutions in
01:09:01 [W] Acres and one size does not fit all but we think that as a community we can do an even better job of highlighting the best Solutions in Cloud native and helping end users identify, which
01:09:19 [W] And helping end users identify which project is best for their particular circumstances.
01:09:27 [W] This also includes making sure that project governance is confidence inspiring as ever.
01:09:34 [W] We're not proposing to impose any particular form of governance. But we do want to provide advice and support for project leaders who might want help in this complex area.
01:09:47 [W] So another prediction the cncf will be able to provide additional support and ideas for governance models that work for contributors and users are like let's keep Cloud native well-governed.
01:10:04 [W] I feel on pretty safe ground on this next prediction.
01:10:07 [W] The number of projects involved will grow there will continue to be a ton of innovation and we'll see more community-driven collaborative projects joining the cncf +
01:10:23 [W] includes lots of vendors building complementary projects in the cloud knative space
01:10:22 [W] So that's cncf landscape.
01:10:24 [W] I'm looking forward to some downtime over the Christmas holidays with a nice jigsaw puzzle folks like to joke about the cncf landscape and how you need a microscope to read it, but in all seriousness
01:10:39 [W] Folks like to Jake about the cncf landscape and how you need a microscope to read it.
01:10:43 [W] But in all seriousness, there are lots of people who find it useful especially in its online form to find out about projects that might help solve a particular problem they have
01:10:57 [W] but I think we can do better to help users find their way around their options for a cloud native stack.
01:11:06 [W] I think I'm speaking not just for the TOC but also for the cncf staff when I say that creative ideas on this are welcome.
01:11:16 [W] So far I've talked about how we operate as an organization and a community, but now let's focus on the technology, which is what we get really excited about right working with my talented colleagues on the TOC.
01:11:31 [W] We came up with five emerging themes and technologies that we think are ones to watch in 2021.
01:11:39 [W] in no particular order
01:11:43 [W] we're seeing projects aiming to make resilience and Chaos engine earring easy to incorporate in your deployments.
01:11:51 [W] When your applications use many pluggable and Loosely coupled components, it's hard to test the resilience of the overall system.
01:12:00 [W] It seems likely that in the not-too-distant future.
01:12:03 [W] It will be common practice to use chaosmesh engineering to test how your applications handle failure scenarios and unexpected events.
01:12:13 [W] While many ngos is today are running their kubernative clusters.
01:12:17 [W] Holy located in data centers or the public Cloud.
01:12:22 [W] We're seeing more and more applications where notes or entire clusters operate at a physical distance.
01:12:29 [W] We are now hosting projects that explore various different models for running components distributed at the edge.
01:12:38 [W] It won't stop at orchestration will need other cloudevents.
01:12:43 [W] Knative components for the edge too.
01:12:47 [W] servicemeshcon
01:13:12 [W] webassembly Andy BPF will be hot Technologies in 2021.
01:13:18 [W] Well, those are essentially unrelated. They share some interesting characteristics like sandboxing high performance and customization the make them really applicable for use in solutions to a range of
01:13:33 [W] We're expecting to see a proliferation of projects to address the developer and operator experience.
01:13:37 [W] We need to make workflows that easier and allow developers to free themselves from the implementation details like yeah, Milland gitops.
01:13:49 [W] There's unlikely to be a single user experience that fits every use case.
01:13:54 [W] So we are fans of pluggable dashboards and extensible API driven you eyes we're seeing developer portals that make it easy to share common practices and tooling across organizations
01:14:09 [W] Schools built on top of Cloud native Technologies to take the idea of an integrated development environment to a whole new level and lower the barrier to contribution.
01:13:57 [W] I hope all the VCS and analysts have been taking notes.
01:14:00 [W] There's plenty of work to be done outside these areas.
01:14:05 [W] Do you remember two years ago in Seattle Janet quo described kubernative as very boring
01:14:13 [W] And she didn't mean that working on it was boring.
01:14:16 [W] She meant that it had moved into the mainstream.
01:14:20 [W] That's happening to more and more of our projects as they become mature and get adopted by lots of large organizations.
01:14:29 [W] There's tons of exciting and interesting work to be done to move Cloud native projects into the mainstream and keep Cloud native everywhere.
01:14:48 [W] Thank you, Liz.
01:14:49 [W] Let's give her a round of applause now. Our next speaker is Chris an effect.
01:14:57 [W] So I want everyone to welcome Chris Anna check the CTO of the Linux Foundation to present the cncf maintainer and Ambassador words of 2020.
01:15:05 [W] Hey everyone.
01:15:04 [W] It's a pleasure to be here live in Austin.
01:15:06 [W] It's just been amazing to have 23,000 people attending Cube con this time around.
01:15:13 [W] This is truly one of my favorite, you know activities for the conference, you know towards the tail end of this.
01:15:22 [W] Let me go to share my screen really quick so we can get started with the awards.
01:15:37 [W] Alrighty, so I am you know absolutely stoked to present these every year. It's been truly an honor to serve this community for the last five years really since you know Day Zero.
01:15:52 [W] I was talking to everyone, you know, slack Twitter and all these different communication mediums.
01:15:42 [W] You know, it really kind of dawned on me that you know Community is truly a precious thing.
01:15:49 [W] You know, I saw this tweet from Leia that you know, jokingly at most valuable conative Foundation project is our community and I somewhat agree.
01:15:57 [W] There's so many folks that do an amazing job ensuring that our community is welcome.
01:16:01 [W] Well above and beyond normal normal day-to-day.
01:16:06 [W] Leti so I'm just you know, totally share this sentiment and you know, thank everyone that goes above and beyond in making sure this is a welcome Place given especially how much we have grown over the years to encompassed different projects different
01:16:21 [W] Different countries and everything so it's kind of kick things off.
01:16:20 [W] Our first award to hand out is our top ambassador award.
01:16:26 [W] Our ambassadors are folks who represent, you know, the community and public through giving talks organizing events and so on if you see the previous list of Award winners here, we truly have
01:16:41 [W] Of an amazing set of folks from you know, Kelsey being the OG ambassador to Lucas if it was maybe like 17 at the time when he won that award to Sarah Michael and Lappy all these fantastic people for this time around.
01:16:49 [W] I'm excited that you know, the top Ambassador for 2020 is an amazing person.
01:16:58 [W] They have been promoting the you know, it's called The Art of improving climate of security across our
01:17:06 [W] System throughout the last couple years, so I would like to congratulate in cold water on winning this award this year.
01:17:17 [W] So hopefully we could go pop out and see her really quickly and she could leave.
01:17:36 [W] and
01:17:39 [W] oh, no.
01:17:40 [W] Alright, we had a bug.
01:17:46 [W] Joy
01:17:58 [W] We will move on wonderful intrado giving us wonderful issues today.
01:18:02 [W] So let's keep on rollin with our roads.
01:18:06 [W] Thank you negate they have been an amazing Ambassador for us also.
01:18:14 [W] Let's do it again.
01:18:17 [W] All right.
01:18:18 [W] we're back.
01:18:22 [W] I thank you again.
01:18:26 [W] All right. Our next set of awards are dedicated to top committers and maintainers.
01:18:33 [W] These are folks who have put forth and done an amazing job in the community in terms of supporting projects that are involved and we just have a fantastic set of folks that span the mid-eighties Prometheus in a variety of projects this year the
01:18:48 [W] Maintainer is existing containers have nominated a set of folks and decided to award the special honor to an elder from the communities Community.
01:19:00 [W] Not sure if any of you know been one of the primary authors of kind tool that I love and use quite quite often and is just one of the most helpful people in the community answering a variety of questions.
01:19:11 [W] So, let's see if we could pop up then onto our screen.
01:19:15 [W] All right.
01:19:18 [W] Hey, Ben. Alright now we're going to technical glitches are over get to see puppy and head.
01:19:24 [W] head. So, thank you Ben and thanks for all your contributions.
01:19:28 [W] All right, bring it back to our Awards.
01:19:33 [W] Sheriff perfect.
01:19:35 [W] Awesome.
01:19:35 [W] We're back.
01:19:36 [W] Thank you Ben our final set of awards which I think you know kind of our most important set of awards truly represent one of our values the most important values in the
01:19:51 [W] Chopping wood and carrying water for those of you who are not familiar phrase.
01:19:48 [W] These are essentially all the things that happen, you know behind the scenes from things like improving, you know, build times, you know performance generally not kind of feature facing work truly stuff that kind of keeps everything functional.
01:20:02 [W] We just had an amazing set of folks that have contributed over time in this and this year.
01:20:08 [W] year. I'm happy to announce our next slate of folks that have been nominated.
01:20:14 [W] Voted upon by both the cncf staff and our wonderful Toc so for 2020 we have Aaron Boyd Josh burkas Bridget, Matt and Richie, you know all fantastic human beings and
01:20:30 [W] On screen hopefully with their wonderful chop wood buckets and or it's good to see everybody loved it.
01:20:29 [W] Richie's the best.
01:20:30 [W] Yeah.
01:20:30 [W] So thank you everyone for all your work. And you know, I look forward to when we were able to see each other again face to face because truly all of you deserve to be on stage with over 20,000 people watching keynote also
01:20:45 [W] You know wrap wrap things up, you know, you know, I look forward to seeing everyone at the next Cube Khan and thank you for everyone who has participated in our communities. We do these awards every year and
01:20:56 [W] Do our best to make sure that folks that are welcome and do amazing things are recognized for their amazing work.
01:21:01 [W] So thank you all and look forward to seeing everyone next year. I'm gonna go hand it back to constants and Stephen to take us the end.
01:21:18 [W] Thank you, Chris.
01:21:19 [W] Thank you. Everyone for joining us this week Carol. I like do the puppy face before he walks away because he's not taking it anywhere. And I know he wants to sleep.
01:21:31 [W] There's like too much screen time.
01:21:32 [W] like I can't handle is popular, please everyone stop giving me all this attention on the internet. I direct a lot of it adoration. I'm going to share this quick anecdote before we actually do the official wrapping up Kota.
01:21:46 [W] Is known for ignoring people and so every time if you're to meet him in person, he will ignore you.
01:21:50 [W] So what he likes to do is he likes to maintain eye contact smile at you and as you pet goat a pet him, he does a 180 and purposely walks away.
01:21:57 [W] So like this attend like this Fame just gets to his head. It's really dangerous for both of us.
01:22:02 [W] But anyways, so while we wish we could have all been together in person.
01:22:08 [W] It's a fortunate situation that we're still able to come together, even if it's virtually so I want to thank everyone for participating in Twitter watching talk so many anynines.
01:22:16 [W] Recording talks.
01:22:14 [W] We know that if released from our personal experience.
01:22:18 [W] It is very hard to participate in this and so thank you everyone for putting in the energy and now I know of course because you know, we're all planning for the next one our next virtual Cuca knative Khan will be in Europe.
01:22:30 [W] It will be the year of chapter is happening May 4th through May 7th, 2021, and the cfps are open now.
01:22:37 [W] And so they're now please submit we want to see more cfps, and they're open until December 13th and sponsorships are still available.
01:22:47 [W] So I think you know by now that I really really love the community. One of my favorite parts of this conference is getting to see the community Awards.
01:22:58 [W] So just wanted to reiterate the shout out to everyone who who won an award everyone who is doing phenomenal work for all of the cloud native projects. You are my friends and family and I'm happy to work with all of you every day
01:23:13 [W] Is now join the keynote speakers within the keynote slack channel. So that's 2 Cube con Keynotes and we'll be hanging out for the next 15 minutes or so to answer any questions that you may have had.
01:23:22 [W] had. I know there's been like really wonderful this course throughout and lots of like high fives and waves and anecdotes and thank you, okay.
01:23:32 [W] And honkin ha ha ha.
01:23:37 [W] So the last set of breakout sessions will begin at through 10:00 eastern time.
01:23:43 [W] Yeah, and that's that's almost it.
01:23:46 [W] That's all right.
01:23:47 [W] Thank you for yeah. Thank you for joining us.
01:23:50 [W] Yeah.
01:23:51 [W] Thank you everyone.
01:23:59 [W] Our job is to make kubernative easier and easier and easier to use either from an Ops point of view or developer point of view while acknowledging it is complex because we're solving a complex problem.
01:24:58 [W] Kubernative will be boring as soon as we can make it boring.
01:25:01 [W] Maybe after I retire it's already boring.
01:25:05 [W] So I think we're well on our journey towards kubernative being boring.
01:25:08 [W] It'll only be boring when it's done.
01:25:10 [W] It'll only be done when it's no longer relevant.
01:28:47 [W] our job is to make kubermatic easier and easier and easier to use either from an Ops point of view or developer point of view while acknowledging it is complex because
01:28:56 [W] We're solving a complex problem.
01:29:57 [W] Kubernative will be boring as soon as we can make it boring.
01:30:00 [W] Maybe after I retire it's already boring.
01:30:03 [W] So I think we're well on our journey towards kubernative being boring.
01:30:07 [W] It'll only be boring when it's done.
01:30:09 [W] It'll only be done when it's no longer relevant.
04:26:23 [W0] Hey everyone. My name is Christina is like I'm super excited to be.
04:26:56 [W1] Everyone, my name is Kristina is like I'm super excited to be here today to present the community towards this is truly one of my favorite activities of the year when it comes to cncf we have so many amazing community members all over the world
04:27:11 [W1] day in a tireless way to you know, improve the state of the things and you know, as I kind of look back on, you know my role, you know, kind of been with cncf since day Zero it's been over five years now and I think one thing that I reflect on you
04:27:26 [W1] Five years now, and I think one thing that I reflect on, you know is you know Community truly is precious.
04:27:30 [W1] There is this tweet that caught my attention from a Committee Member Leia that you know, kind of jokingly said that you know, the most valuable cncf project is our community and you know, I completely agree like the
04:27:46 [W1] Out there that you know serve, you know tirelessly helping folks out is amazing and something that I just completely blows me away every every day. So without you know any further Ado I'd like to go and start our process to introduce our
04:28:00 [W1] Every day, so without any further Ado I'd like to go and start our process to introduce our three main awards for today.
04:28:08 [W1] First up is our ambassador award.
04:28:12 [W1] So this kind of reflects, you know, people who go out and publicly speak spreading, you know, the claim clown admission educating people about projects or Community hosting events doing all sorts of things that just benefit the whole ecosystem
04:28:27 [W1] Doing all sorts of things that just benefit the whole ecosystem.
04:28:30 [W1] If you look at the previous winners of this award we have you know, Kelsey Hightower or OG Ambassador, you know Lucas who you know, I believe one this is when he was like 17 venerable Sarah Novotny Michael and Lackey who are just fantastic people have done so much.
04:28:45 [W1] To you know, get the cloud native message out there and so for 2020, you know this Community member, you know, they have been quite phenomenal phenomenal.
04:28:55 [W1] I've been following them on Twitter for a while, especially around security related things and in cognitive and super stoked to announce today that Ian cold water has won the top ambassador award for 2020.
04:29:10 [W1] Aztec job spreading Colonnade of security practices and in general just making things fun and approachable for everyone.
04:29:14 [W1] So congratulations Ian and glad to you know, have you win the award this year?

00:00:00 [W] Kubernative will be boring as soon as we can make it boring.
00:00:03 [W] Maybe after I retire it's already boring.
00:00:06 [W] So I think we're well on our journey towards kubernative being boring.
00:00:10 [W] It'll only be boring when it's done.
00:00:12 [W] It'll only be done when it's no longer relevant.
00:00:53 [W] It'll only be boring when it's done.
00:00:56 [W] It'll only be done when it's no longer relevant.
00:01:54 [W] Our job is to make kubernative easier and easier and easier to use either from an Ops point of view or developer point of view while acknowledging it is complex because we're solving a complex problem.
00:05:45 [W] Kubernative will be boring as soon as we can make it boring.
00:05:48 [W] Maybe after I retire.
00:05:51 [W] It's already boring.
00:05:52 [W] So I think we're well on our journey towards kubernative being boring.
00:05:55 [W] It'll only be boring when it's done.

00:07:33 [W] Hello everyone and welcome to day 3 or day for depending if you do index starting at 1 or 0 to Coke on North America 2020 in the last set of key notes.
00:07:42 [W] Really well, and so to validate my assumption, please do the round of applause for everyone over the past few days both in terms of kolos events and Keynotes and amazing presentations.
00:07:39 [W] And so to start off the first keynote of the day.
00:07:44 [W] we are going to be hearing from the lovely my lovely co-chair Steven Steven Augustus, you know, you should probably should be familiar to you by now. He is a senior open source engineer of VMware and today
00:07:58 [W] say he will discuss slowing down the release Cadence of kubernative with a more deliberate not deliverable deliberate approach, please welcome back Steve and Augustus and let's give him a round of applause and Slack
00:08:20 [W] Hello.
00:08:21 [W] Hello everyone.
00:08:23 [W] My name is Steven Augustus. And I am one of your co-chairs for Kube con Cloud native con and a virtual 2020 when I'm not reviewing your lovely Toc submissions or putting
00:08:38 [W] black
00:08:38 [W] hello.
00:08:39 [W] Hello everyone.
00:08:40 [W] My name is Steven Augustus. And I'm one of your co-chairs for Kube con Cloud native con and a virtual 2020 when I'm not reviewing your lovely Toc submissions or putting
00:09:16 [W] A program for what?
00:09:18 [W] I truly believe is one of the best conferences in the world.
00:09:21 [W] I am a senior open source engineer at VMware now it's in the title, but let's go a little deeper on the open-source bits.
00:09:33 [W] My day-to-day is spending time in a open source project that is near and dear to my heart and you may have heard of it.
00:09:43 [W] It's called kubernative.
00:09:46 [W] So today I wanted to take some time to talk to you a little bit about the kubernative A's project and more specifically the release cycle for the kubernetes project now.
00:10:02 [W] In the community I serve as a co-chair for Sig release as well as one of the senior release managers now what that means is honestly I have I have the opportunity to interface with
00:10:16 [W] I have the opportunity to interface with a bunch of lovely people to manage a group of rock stars.
00:10:20 [W] really. So I wanted to I wanted to give you a little bit of their view into the release cycle and some of the discussions that we've had across 2020.
00:10:36 [W] Now something interesting happened in 2020, and I'm not sure that it has happened to frequently if at all in the project and that's we slow down. We slow down the release Cadence during
00:10:51 [W] The 119 release and we did it. Deliberately.
00:10:56 [W] We did it to give an opportunity for people to to really live through the the 2020 of it all and in making that decision it was it was not about technology.
00:11:12 [W] It's 20 of it all and in making that decision it was it was not about technology.
00:11:15 [W] It's very much.
00:11:16 [W] So about the the people I think it's going to ring true as you as you view the talks across the week that the the contributors maintainers of the kubernetes project very deeply care about the
00:11:32 [W] The people who work on the project the people who consume what we produce every day.
00:11:40 [W] Now one of the interesting questions that was asked as we slow down the release Cadence The Slowdown of the release Cadence resulted in what will be only three releases for the
00:11:55 [W] For the 2020 calendar year and the question was?
00:12:00 [W] Is this permanent?
00:12:02 [W] Is that something that's going to continue to happen right now?
00:12:06 [W] We have a set of folks that are that are of differing opinions and I was interested in getting some feedback here and kind of coalescing all of that into one place now.
00:12:21 [W] Decided to do something incredibly scientific and I started a Twitter poll to ask would you prefer three releases are for for the year?
00:12:27 [W] And I got some great responses.
00:12:29 [W] I got some really really great responses some well-thought-out one some funny ones as well as offering options, like releasing releasing twice a year releasing once a year talking about LTS,
00:12:45 [W] On a nightly basis releasing on a weekly basis, right? So lots of different options to consider and layered onto those options is what is best for
00:12:57 [W] Unity what is best for the people who have to produce kubernative what is best for the people who are Downstream contributor contributors to Downstream projects?
00:13:05 [W] What are the what are the trade-offs for end user communities that need to consume kubernative?
00:13:14 [W] What are the trade-offs for vendors cloud cloud providers that are interested in consuming kubernative.
00:13:21 [W] Zar published distributions.
00:13:22 [W] s of kubernative
00:13:25 [W] Now I'm going to kind of rapid-fire some of the feedback that was given, but firstly I'll say that there was overwhelming support for three releases as opposed to four for the year.
00:13:40 [W] Now one of the things that I consider as as one of the co-chairs of Sig release is the overhead to actually crank the wheel that is that is kubernative, right?
00:13:55 [W] a a minor release of kubenetes and and part of that is is communication a huge part of that is communication usually affectionately call the the incoming release team lead the
00:14:09 [W] Cat herder of the group. The release team is a group of somewhere between at any one cycle 25 and 40 people and 40 people now all of those people
00:14:13 [W] one we have to recruit those people to all of those people are responsible for delivering delivering feedback from the various cigs sub-projects component areas
00:14:26 [W] It's back into Sig release so that we can get an accurate picture of what's happening for right now the quarter and and maybe maybe later something different in terms of cadence.
00:14:38 [W] So one of the big things I consider is is the overhead to actually spin up a team every cycle right that takes that takes at least two weeks if we're if we're doing it quickly and a little more
00:14:53 [W] Lee spin up a team every cycle right that takes that takes at least two weeks if we're if we're doing it quickly and a little more if we're considering holidays feedback
00:15:10 [W] Ring holidays feedback reaching out to people doing interviews.
00:15:15 [W] So on and so forth.
00:15:16 [W] So that's one component of it.
00:15:18 [W] The other another component is the release engineering tooling right? So some of the release engineering tooling that we use today has been in place from close to the Inception of the project, right?
00:15:32 [W] So considerations around how we build functionality into new sets of tools.
00:15:40 [W] And how we start to spin down the old right the goal being that the new tools are more sustainable more likely to have to attract contributors to our group.
00:15:54 [W] group. So on and so forth, right?
00:15:56 [W] So also considering data so Sig cluster lifecycle recently had a survey where the data does support that people would be interested in future releases now, why
00:16:12 [W] Polly to have to attract contributors to our group so on and so forth, right?
00:16:19 [W] So also considering data so Sig cluster lifecycle recently had a survey where the data does support that people would be interested in in future releases now, why
00:16:50 [W] I think I think kind of with the 2020 theme but also every other year people are struggling to keep up now as a former former field
00:17:05 [W] Architect at Cloud native leaders like Coral s and red hat. I've had the opportunity to see up close what users have to deal with as they consider moving to kubernative
00:17:20 [W] What users have to deal with as they consider moving to kubernative a sore upgrading kubernative A's and and the kind of the kind of work that's involved there from a company perspective.
00:17:33 [W] Of the kind of work that's involved there from a company perspective as well as the work that needs to not happen in order for that to happen moving moving
00:17:48 [W] As well as the work that needs to not happen in order for that to happen moving moving to New infrastructure means that you spend less time on building building for for stability.
00:18:03 [W] Means that you spend less time building and deploying features, right? So that's something to consider from the end user perspective as well.
00:18:11 [W] now
00:18:13 [W] For for users, at least one of those release cycles that we have for the year.
00:18:20 [W] Their focus is is you know is pointing somewhere else, right and it's as I mentioned whether it's delivering features delivering stability for their internal platforms applications and again something that
00:18:35 [W] To consider now something that I love that happened towards the end of the 119 really cycle is that we had an extended code freeze and we had an extended.
00:18:44 [W] hold on thawing in the code essentially making kubernative the kubernative kubernative repo ready to accept merges again, so we have various various tooling that allows us to
00:18:59 [W] To gate merges for on Milestones on whether or not something is approved on whether the tests are failing or not.
00:19:04 [W] And
00:19:05 [W] I saw the opportunity both from the Sig release side from the Sig testing side from a slew of of Sig chair component of project areas in
00:19:21 [W] Areas in improving the way that we test the infrastructure that we test upon and that was a net positive for the project.
00:19:29 [W] So being able to build stability and some more of the processes that we that we care about day to day that we have to kind of live through day-to-day is important as well.
00:19:43 [W] Now some some people brought up the fear of accumulating risk and Technical debt in the project and to be frank with you.
00:19:55 [W] We've already done it.
00:19:57 [W] We've already done it.
00:19:59 [W] We've already done it. So I think this is a good opportunity for us to step back.
00:20:03 [W] Look at open issues. Look at things that are in previous Milestones. Look at things that are targeted for targeted as priority important long-term.
00:20:14 [W] And and think about how to plan out those projects think about how to deliver enhancements in a more sustainable way, right?
00:20:25 [W] So Sig responsibilities things like the API policies the feature graduation changes making it possible for more people to consume kubernative A's releases whether they
00:20:40 [W] It possible for more people to consume kubernative A's releases whether they be pre-releases miners are seized the the patch releases that come out monthly all of that is kind of composed in this.
00:20:55 [W] Ori as well as driving down the the rush to review during code freeze testing very specific things more often and figuring out what all of the downstream implications are for
00:21:10 [W] You day to day so really in closing I would ask you to to be vocal about what you want as we consider changes to the release process have the conversation with us in slack on the
00:21:24 [W] Cross the cigs if you want to reach out via DM and chat about this feel free.
00:21:28 [W] Feel free to come to come to us because we want to make a decision and we want to make a decision considering everyone who's involved whether it be a contributor maintainer Downstream consumer end users Cloud providers.
00:21:42 [W] So come come come and play.
00:21:44 [W] Thank you for your time everyone. Have a good day.
00:21:50 [W] Awesome.
00:21:51 [W] Thank you Stephen.
00:21:52 [W] Let's give him a round of applause and the select Channel especially what I really like about Steven's talk, right?
00:21:58 [W] It's you know, it's an in response to the current times.
00:22:01 [W] Maybe it is a really good opportunity for all of us to reflect upon the you know, the pace of you're working on before covid before all these changes happen to our work life is that you know, maybe we were all burning the candle at both ends and we need you to find a way that's more sustainable.
00:22:17 [W] I really love this message now.
00:22:16 [W] Let's go on to our next set of speakers. Our next presenters are Guinevere Sanger.
00:22:23 [W] Oops.
00:22:23 [W] Sorry going to vary forgot to ask it how to pronounce your name beforehand and Leah Peterson Guinevere. The software engineer at GitHub and Leia is a reliability engineer at to Sigma Investments rating today.
00:22:35 [W] Apparently is very hard for me. Now today, they'll talk about the Ada developers Academy and the work the graduates do please welcome Guinevere and Leah.
00:22:55 [W] Hi everybody.
00:22:56 [W] Thank you for joining us today.
00:23:00 [W] So we're all here at Cube Kong to learn more about Cloud Technologies.
00:23:04 [W] If we could look around the room right now, we would see a huge group of people with different backgrounds and skills all leveraging Cloud Technologies for different reasons.
00:23:16 [W] In fact saying I guess we're all Cloud Engineers now has become a bit of a complaint throughout the industry.
00:23:25 [W] So today we want to talk about who are we building these Cloud Technologies for the computers to make them run faster to make them more reliable.
00:23:35 [W] Why are we doing this?
00:23:36 [W] In general depends on cloud computing more and more especially in these socially distant times.
00:23:36 [W] So as the definition of a cloud user expands we have to make sure we're building tools that help this diverse user base Leverage The Cloud.
00:23:50 [W] So how do we build great tools for a set of users who aren't like us?
00:23:57 [W] We work with a team of developers who aren't like us to build strong tools.
00:24:02 [W] We need engineering teams with many different skills backgrounds and perspectives.
00:24:10 [W] Let's take a look at some Cloud Engineers out there.
00:24:17 [W] Hi, I'm gonna be here as a musician.
00:24:20 [W] I learned to quickly recognize patterns, which now helps me to design and build intuitive to pulley tooling that is easy to use for every engineer at GitHub.
00:24:33 [W] Hello, my name is Leah.
00:24:36 [W] I bring several skills from my previous job as a motorcycle stunt Rider to my role as a reliability engineer today, including breaking down big and sometimes scary problems creating a plan and knowing when to just go for it
00:24:51 [W] Skills have helped me both learn how to do a wheelie and also migrate services to the cloud.
00:24:51 [W] We would also like to highlight two pain who uses her skills breaking down content to speak to people with different experience levels to help her build open source Cloud authentication tools.
00:25:07 [W] As a software engineer at hashicorp to who would support struggling teammates in a constructive way to help her team move forward and resolve conflict, which is a skill that she developed in her previous role managing students teachers and families in a business context.
00:25:24 [W] And finally, I'm only a musician turned software engineer who uses her skills from her eclectic background to build platforms that help Google Cloud users manage their billing and budgets.
00:25:36 [W] It's so what do all of these Engineers have in common you thought I was gonna say kubernative.
00:25:46 [W] It's didn't you in fact, it's that we all learned how to code and got jobs in the tech industry.
00:25:52 [W] Thanks to Ada developers Academy.
00:25:58 [W] Is a developers Academy is a non-profit tuition-free coding school in Seattle aimed at women and gender diverse adults and it has a great social justice mission.
00:26:10 [W] If you're interested in leveraging the Ada Network to bring different perspectives to your engineering team.
00:26:02 [W] There are a few ways you can get involved first. You can sponsor an intern or you could consider hiring a graduate from our ever growing pool of graduates from the Boot Camp or you could support or attend our
00:26:17 [W] I'm conference, which is called a t-con and you can get more information about that at a deacon.com.
00:26:12 [W] So to wrap this up while maybe not everyone is a cloud engineer.
00:26:18 [W] Everyone is in fact a cloud user.
00:26:21 [W] And with that we can say that to keep Cloud native everywhere.
00:26:26 [W] We must work with Engineers that do in fact come from everywhere.
00:26:33 [W] Thank you.
00:26:34 [W] Thank you.
00:26:39 [W] Thank you. Gwen and Leah right like we all especially I got the chance to work with go ahead and lay up for the presentation and you know, it is very true that different backgrounds provide so much more
00:26:54 [W] You know like the interaction right like that.
00:26:53 [W] You learn all these different set of questions to ask and you bring them to your community.
00:26:56 [W] And so it is really wonderful what it is doing and encourage everyone to look into it. Now the next keynote is very exciting Steve for everyone. Mostly because this is the first time we're doing a panel
00:27:11 [W] And so I want to welcome for lovely humans.
00:27:00 [W] Now this consists and there are circuity subject matter experts in cold water Duffy coolly bread Jessamine and Rory McCune Ian is a kubernative Sig co-chair and cncf Ambassador
00:27:15 [W] Hacking and Harden kubernative containers and cloudevents structure.
00:27:17 [W] Duffy is a Solutions architect at Apple.
00:27:20 [W] Brad is co-founder of dark bit and Rory is principal consultant at NC cgroup and a few weeks ago.
00:27:28 [W] They requested questions from the community centered around security and hacking and their unofficial special interest group Sig honk now instead of a normal clap.
00:27:40 [W] I encourage everyone to use the good old Goose. So
00:27:43 [W] please welcome Ian Duffy Brad and Rory with a good old round of goosing in the slack Channel.
00:28:15 [W] Hi, everybody greetings from Sunny Minneapolis where it is just as cold and snowy as it would be in Boston if we were all in the same place, welcome to the Sig honk ask us anything panel at coupon North America 2020 virtual
00:28:31 [W] Official kubernative special interest group.
00:28:25 [W] We are a hacker crew and a group of friends who have been working on various aspects of kubernative security for a long time now and we're super excited to be here. These questions have been brought To Us by the community and thank you all for submitting them.
00:28:36 [W] So thanks for being here with us.
00:28:38 [W] Let's introduce ourselves.
00:28:40 [W] My name is Ian cold water.
00:28:42 [W] I come from a devops turned pentesting background.
00:28:45 [W] I am now the co-chair of kubernative Sig security and the new director of Dessa cups at twilio. I've been hacking on kublr.
00:28:53 [W] Genetics things for about four years now, and I'm super excited to be here.
00:28:58 [W] Hey everyone.
00:28:59 [W] My name is Duffy coolly, and my pronouns are he/him.
00:29:03 [W] I've been playing with networks distributed systems and people in this space for quite a while and I really enjoy making in communities like kubernative like more approachable and and certainly more inclusive. So if you have any questions or anything I can ever do to help just
00:29:19 [W] I'm super excited to be here.
00:29:11 [W] Hey everyone.
00:29:12 [W] My name is Duffy coolly, and my pronouns are he/him.
00:29:16 [W] I've been playing with networks distributed systems and people in this space for quite a while and I really enjoy making in communities like kubernative like more approachable and and certainly more inclusive.
00:29:28 [W] So if you have any questions or anything I can ever do to help just reach out.
00:29:31 [W] I'm happy to do it.
00:29:32 [W] I've recently transitioned to Apple and and now I'm doing some of that work there. So I'm really excited to be here.
00:29:39 [W] Oh my pronouns, are they them to hi everyone. So, my name is Remi.
00:29:43 [W] Kin. My poor nouns are he/him.
00:29:45 [W] I'm a principal consultant at NCI cgroup where I focus mainly on doing security tests and assessments for customers and I be looking containerd security data for about four five years.
00:29:56 [W] I'm Brad giesemann. My pronouns are he/him.
00:29:59 [W] And I'm the co-founder of dark pit a consultancy focused on cloud and kubernetes security posture assessments.
00:30:05 [W] I've been building you hacking on kubernative for almost four years now as well.
00:30:09 [W] And yes, gieselmann is my real last name, but it's no coincidence that I was pretty much born a hunk speaking of that though.
00:30:16 [W] I suppose we should explain what all the honking is about. So the honk thing came from a video game called Untitled Goose game, which was published by a company called house house about a year ago.
00:30:26 [W] In time on total Goose game. The protagonist is a mischievous goose who runs around a pastoral English Village causing trouble on purpose this goose in this game kind of sneaks around and uses seemingly innocuous everyday
00:30:42 [W] Assessments I've been building in hacking on kubernative for almost four years now as well.
00:30:46 [W] yes, gieselmann is my real last name, but it's no coincidence that I was pretty much born honk speaking of that though. I suppose we should explain what all the honking is about.
00:30:57 [W] So the honk thing came from a video game called Untitled Goose game, which was published by a company called house house about a year ago entitled Goose game. The protagonist is a mischievous goose who runs around a pastoral English Village causing trouble on purpose
00:31:46 [W] to chain them together to perhaps do something like exploit them for its own ends because of this because it's kind of like the way hackers do things some of us hackers kind of adopted this Goose as a mascot of sorts and when we talk about honking a lot of the time
00:32:01 [W] About hacking or just causing problems on purpose.
00:32:04 [W] I have a question for you all so we've all been working on kubernative for a minute.
00:32:10 [W] How do you think that the security posture and attack surface has changed with more modern Cloud native text acts over the old way of doing things.
00:32:18 [W] That's a great question.
00:32:21 [W] I think you know in my mind the old way was when we would rack up a thousand servers or start up a bunch of virtual machines, and then we would leverage tools to deploy some subset of our application to
00:32:31 [W] A subset of those nodes, right?
00:32:33 [W] And and with that old way we had all kinds of interesting challenges like, you know shared libraries and other problems that would that would be inherent when we were trying to couple different applications on two particular nodes and the new way, we we're dealing with containerd
00:32:48 [W] In with a very similar model in which we're dropping applications on to some subset of those nodes or running them as long time or long running processes just like we did before but the difference is that now, you know where some of the benefits of this new
00:33:03 [W] Come into play is that now we're actually giving each of those running processes their own view of the network their own view of the filesystem their own view of the pit namespace and these things mean that we actually have better
00:33:12 [W] Says because we can actually containerize them.
00:33:14 [W] This is effectively what container Rising is is basically just giving that running process its own isolated view of the world.
00:33:23 [W] And so I do think that that has improved security but it hasn't changed a too much as we look at the way that those processes interact with the colonel.
00:33:32 [W] Yeah, I think for me one of the big things about moving to communities and Cloud native has been this move to automation is beating this process of everything being, you know, automated and and infrastructure as code and that's kind of got trade-offs.
00:33:45 [W] It's got good things for security and it's got some things that are challenges.
00:33:48 [W] the good things for me. One of the big ones is about repeatability this idea that you know, I can take this code and I can create you know, 10 20 30 environments I want from you is a security test. It means I can say hey spin me up a new environment just for my test.
00:34:02 [W] And I can be confident that my findings, you know, they're going to be relevant in the same ones as you're going to see in production.
00:34:07 [W] So that's great.
00:34:08 [W] But the downside is that we have to think about things differently now, so we don't have pets servers anymore.
00:34:13 [W] We can't just load all our secrets up manually. We have to work out how we're going to store them and how we're going to manage them securely and that's one of the problems the new problems that we have to think about and also with everything being in the cloud, you know, we have to think well, everything's exposed.
00:34:26 [W] Everything is one step away from being compromised. So we have to be really careful with how we manage our information and access to things.
00:34:32 [W] Because it's all out there just sitting on the cloud.
00:34:34 [W] Being in the cloud, you know, we have to think well, everything's exposed.
00:34:33 [W] Everything is one step away from being compromised.
00:34:35 [W] So it'd be really careful with how we manage our information and access to things because it's all out there just sitting on the cloud.
00:34:42 [W] Yeah, I think there are a lot of benefits.
00:34:45 [W] I mean the moved in API driven infrastructure and configuration means that there's so many more opportunities to bake security improvements into the code.
00:34:54 [W] That is the source of Truth as opposed to say only being able to bolt it on later and those same apis make it much easier to query about those security settings at scale one, you know one place you clear everything you can see what the actual answer is,
00:35:09 [W] of a security policy or Miss configuration its present is probably present everywhere that makes it much easier to fix because it's all on a central spot and you can have it reliably take effect on the whole Fleet and that brings a lot less overall toil but
00:35:24 [W] The challenge is is finding that balance of velocity on automation versus complexity and security.
00:35:32 [W] So another question that we got asked is what are we think developers of upstream and downstream cloudevents ology should be thinking about from a security perspective.
00:35:43 [W] So as you all said a minute ago, I mean it's important to just notes in general for people who are building this kind of infrastructure.
00:35:51 [W] That what's old is new again, you know that a lot of these problems of like the old Tech that the shiny Cloud native wrapper is around haven't really quite been solved yet.
00:35:59 [W] So keep an eye on those but also you can't just assume that everything is the same. So keep an eye on that too. If you're building your first party data center in the cloud.
00:36:06 [W] It's probably going to be very expensive and not work exactly the way you think it will but also in general when you're looking at the systems that you
00:36:14 [W] I think it's really important to look at it from the perspective of an attacker because as an attacker, I'm going to be looking at your systems and I'm going to be looking at them in perhaps a different way than you might do.
00:36:25 [W] You actually know what's running in your environment.
00:36:28 [W] Do you actually know exactly what your code does and if you do know what your code does are you including the perspective of an attacker Persona in your user personas if you use those because when I'm looking at a system, I'm looking at it for things like where are the holes in?
00:36:43 [W] In this where are the trust boundaries?
00:36:45 [W] Room when you're building them and think about how an attacker might look at them and what that perspective might look like that can be really valuable and threat model accordingly because having a threat model is really important.
00:36:55 [W] Yeah, I like that and I will paraphrase another friend who says that one of the ways to think about, you know, increasing the security of your of your application or your environment is to think about what tools you might be leaving behind for those attackers
00:37:11 [W] I'd be leaving behind for those attackers and and one of the ways that I conceptualize this is by thinking about like what is packaged inside of a container image right that can't that whole container images going to ship and it's going to be running and it's going to be exposed to that long-running
00:37:19 [W] We're talking about earlier. Right and that means that anything that's inside of that container image will be available. If somebody were to get a reverse shell on that note now.
00:37:27 [W] I understand like the incredible power of having a debugging tool or bash or you know, SCP or any of these amazing tools that you could use to actually like get logs off of the running out of a container or understand what's
00:37:42 [W] Regular process or debugging things but at the same time and and many people actually will bundle these things into their container image because it might be come in handy later.
00:37:51 [W] But at the same time it may not come in handy for you and it may come and come in handy for anybody like even people who have or are working for Anna Faris purposes.
00:38:00 [W] The other thing I think that is useful is talking about these new containerd, you know, this container orchestration model we have to think about like, you know, what privilege has been granted to that process right like
00:38:12 [W] Is it running as a privilege container?
00:38:14 [W] Can it see all of the pins in the host name space?
00:38:17 [W] is it able to manipulate network interfaces? Is it able to do things like this and there's a ton of sharp edges and configurability in this especially with regard to things like kubernative.
00:38:27 [W] But yeah, you know what tools have you left behind? What have you left behind for your attackers is a great way to think about this.
00:38:34 [W] Another great question that came up for us was how do you go about evaluating the attack surface of a cluster on actually attacking it? Like where where do you even begin?
00:38:45 [W] Yeah, that's a really good one.
00:38:47 [W] So for me a lot of what I do focuses on things from a configuration standpoint. So I'll first look at the configuration of the external network and how access to the control plane in the nodes or configure and I'll kind of work my way in and I'll look at the configuration of
00:39:02 [W] environment like say how the cluster situated and what axis it has to other things and then I'm thinking about like the API server and just ruling out the obvious are back flaws like Anonymous secrets to you know access to Secrets or if there's any applicable see bees
00:39:15 [W] And it's sort of like stepping in further kind of like layers of the onion.
00:39:08 [W] I look at the configuration of the kubernative components the cloud credentials that are attached to the worker nodes and then sort of as a unit the combination of our back admission control network access control and container image
00:39:23 [W] And then sort of as a unit the combination of our back admission control network access control and container image contents kind of all is one thing to say, you know, what's the overall security posture of that giving workloads?
00:39:50 [W] that perspective
00:39:52 [W] Yeah, I think that ties a lot of with what we end up doing.
00:39:55 [W] I think when we end up doing security systems for customers, but we typically do is we'll take one of two approaches, you know, will either take this white box approach where we cannot give it access, you know will give it access to comb faced were given access to pull stuff down and they are a lot of what turns out to be happening is we end up doing
00:40:10 [W] Have two approaches, you know, well either take this white box approach where we cannot give an access, you know, we're giving access to calm things were given access to pull stuff down and they are a lot of what turns out to be happening is we end up doing data analysis building large quantities of Json down and parsing it and looking
00:40:25 [W] Sundowning parsing it and looking for patterns, you know, you got a lot of data to look at Automation and parsing is really important and you're looking for patterns that could indicate problems so could be cluster. Admin, you know, this this process runs is class for up and that's going to be dangerous.
00:40:39 [W] It's all going to be a target for me or other attackers.
00:40:41 [W] What about privilege containers is Duffy said before privilege containers can see all the processes they can get a lot more access.
00:40:47 [W] So what's in there that might be running is privileged. But then when we're doing the Black Box what we're doing is really trying to take that scenario and say Hey, you know, hey.
00:40:54 [W] Hey, I am a compromise container. You know, I've got access to this container.
00:40:59 [W] What can I do?
00:40:59 [W] Can I break out the sandbox?
00:41:01 [W] What rights do I have do I maybe have a dock or socket mounted inside my container and maybe where can I go on the network? So these two approaches but you're looking to the same kind of thing. You're looking for patterns of Badness?
00:41:12 [W] Yeah, totally what they said, you know, you want to look at like what exactly is going on in the environment that you're assessing like what's running in there? How is it running what level of privilege does it have?
00:41:24 [W] Is there anything that is potentially exploitable and then if you can get that then you kind of see how far you can go.
00:41:32 [W] Can you break out of the container?
00:41:33 [W] Can you break out of the node?
00:41:36 [W] Can you break out of the cluster itself and go into the cloud? It's really going to vary depending on what?
00:41:41 [W] You find but it's really a matter of like figuring out what's going on.
00:41:45 [W] Seeing how far you can get and a lot of it as y'all said is pattern recognition, but I want to note that if people are watching this who are new to this.
00:41:53 [W] Of us using a lot of pattern recognition to be discouraging to you because this isn't Magic.
00:41:58 [W] It isn't that where like Wizards who have Arcane knowledge that cannot be gained by other people.
00:42:03 [W] It's just that we've had a lot of practice and that's something that you can learn and practice to and for people who are excited about learning how to attack kubernative and this kind of thing.
00:42:11 [W] I want to encourage you to get your hands dirty go in and start practicing how to do that yourself a couple of great resources to do that are there's a workshop that happened at kubeacademy.
00:42:22 [W] Kane last year by Brad and some other awesome flux. You can find it at secure kubernative.com.
00:42:27 [W] It holds up very well with time and you can go all the way through it.
00:42:30 [W] There's also a CTF that happens periodically called honks ETL at one point.
00:42:34 [W] We played it as a team and it was pretty great and I believe that we want it.
00:42:37 [W] And so that's something to look out for and in general playing Capture the Flag games like ctfs not the kind of capture the flag that you played on the playground when you were a kid, but the kind that's like getting to like learn how to hack and sharpen your skills and learn
00:42:52 [W] To think like an attacker is something I really recommend that people do because it can be useful and it's also fun while we're on the subject of pattern recognition.
00:43:02 [W] Another question that we got that I'm going to throw to you. All is if somebody is a defender or a cluster administrator, what are some indicators that a cluster or kubernative environment has been compromised that people should look out for if there's a breach
00:43:17 [W] Is there something that people can see that happened?
00:43:22 [W] Yeah, you know going back to the answer about like how the kubernative security surface has changed.
00:43:29 [W] I think it actually highlights, you know, some of the complexity that we've introduced in this process as well.
00:43:33 [W] So let's think about like the old way and the new way and glue these things together.
00:43:37 [W] So the old way we would have, you know, a subset of our applications running on a subset of nodes and we might configure something like audit D to watch for behavior that we thought was not was not normal right and alert on that and then that would give us the ability to kind of understand that things were
00:43:52 [W] putting in our systems that we're not at that we were not expecting something you might not be expecting is something modifying or opening the file at the password right or the shadow file or any or other like secure, you know things that you would expect that
00:44:07 [W] Not an application would not do during normal experience.
00:44:12 [W] Well now in this new system as we as we described as we explore containerization, we have n number of etsy password files, right because each process has its own file system, right?
00:44:24 [W] And so that definitely adds a bit of complexity to the problem because now we actually have to understand, you know, which password file was attract or it was touched and which container was it running and is that still not normal?
00:44:37 [W] Allure is that okay, right, but understanding that normal behavior and like understanding how to do to detect it has changed. We can't just watch all of the file systems.
00:44:48 [W] We have to change the way we're watching for those things.
00:44:50 [W] There's a great project in the cncf umbrella called Falco and Falco basically operates at the syscall interface.
00:44:57 [W] so it's watching for system calls like file open or a grabbing a file handle on Etsy password against the Linux kernel
00:45:07 [W] And then maintaining the context so that you can understand which containerd has happened in and maintaining the context you can understand which container opened that Network socket and and really provides like a great Next Generation Oddity capability. So
00:45:22 [W] That's definitely how I would start.
00:45:25 [W] Yeah, I'll go with Duffy said about you know, getting visibility into what's happening inside. The containers for that malicious activity is like the primary source, like somebody could control exact or a shell was spawned, you know file connection like tough. He said
00:45:40 [W] Early indicators.
00:45:42 [W] I think the next best place to be looking are the audit logs.
00:45:45 [W] So, you know the API server audit logs and the neighboring Cloud API audit logs are really key in terms of getting that clear Smoking Gun evidence and while it might not be the first thing that captures the compromise.
00:46:00 [W] Probably going to capture a lot of the next steps that the attacker will take because they will most likely find valid credentials somewhere and try those credentials against those apis as they say, you know, can I expand my access inside the cluster
00:46:15 [W] Her privileged escalate or try to escape out into the nose or Escape out into the neighboring Cloud environment.
00:46:21 [W] for me, I think the one-two punch is is malicious activity detection logs and the audit logs in combination so you can really understand what just happened.
00:46:33 [W] So hopefully security incidents like that will continue to be relatively uncommon but one of the questions that might be helpful for cluster administrators to know more about is you know, how do you go about evaluating a project for its overall
00:46:48 [W] Security posture before you take the time to install it and integrate it into your own environment. Like what things are you looking for? And that'll throw that over to you guys?
00:46:58 [W] Yeah, that's a really great question.
00:46:59 [W] And I think obviously there are a huge number of projects in this space.
00:47:02 [W] So it's one you're going to have to spend some time on the first place. I would probably Luke is, you know the cncf security order, of course, you know, every graduated project has gotten older report on by third party. Those are great resources not just for like looking at code bugs, but also for looking at how the project you know, how
00:47:17 [W] What is security posture is like so that's a good starting point.
00:47:21 [W] I'll also tend to look at the websites, you know for each project and say do you have Security contact information, you know, do you are you encouraging secure to be able to get in touch and actually like get involved with the project and then the other place I tend to look is what's the happy path install like
00:47:36 [W] Of faults this project uses.
00:47:38 [W] Are they going to give you a secure installation?
00:47:39 [W] Because that's not tends to be two good indicator as well.
00:47:44 [W] For me, I want to know how exactly the thing works like technically.
00:47:49 [W] What are the details of like what exactly is it doing in there?
00:47:53 [W] What kind of privilege does it ask for?
00:47:55 [W] What kind of access does it need?
00:47:57 [W] Does it have readwrite access to the host to other machines like as an attacker?
00:48:04 [W] I know how I would want to potentially use something to break out of it.
00:48:07 [W] How viable is that? And in general if I'm using it from thinking about using it in my environment? How does it fit into my environment?
00:48:14 [W] What does it require to be connected to does it conflict with anything?
00:48:17 [W] And you know, what does it talk to and how does it fit into my threat model?
00:48:22 [W] Because it's really important as I said earlier to threat model your environment figure out what's in their figure out what's important to you and see if that project is going to fit into that larger goal.
00:48:34 [W] So I have a question for you. All speaking of larger goals.
00:48:37 [W] How do you find inspiration for where to honk next and how do you develop intuition about the emergent behavior of complex systems?
00:48:44 [W] I really like this question.
00:48:45 [W] I think it's fun.
00:48:45 [W] Yeah.
00:48:47 [W] it's a great question.
00:48:48 [W] I for my part.
00:48:49 [W] I think it's a I really maintain curiosity about everything the everything around me all the time.
00:48:55 [W] I'm done.
00:48:56 [W] I'm definitely one of those questioned everything types of people and I find that that's true.
00:49:03 [W] Not just in the way that I evaluate software or the video I evaluate systems but generally in life like I would look at an elevator and realize I'm going to be on this elevator, you know for 20 minutes of my day every day.
00:49:14 [W] So I wonder what else I can learn about this elevator right and might do this research on the type of elevator it is and see if there are any like, you know secret button pushes or tricks to actually opted to change.
00:49:25 [W] the behavior of this elevator into my benefit right like and so for my part, it's definitely curiosity stay curious, you know, like under, you know, take the time to explore that Curiosity and I know that we can all feel very rushed
00:49:40 [W] When we're doing our day-to-day job, but like that Curiosity and you should be celebrated and you know, take some time to maintain that.
00:49:49 [W] Absolutely, I think curiosity is a big part of it and for me like some of the best places I get kind of inspiration is from trying to answer people's questions, you know, seeing someone asked me a simple question go.
00:49:59 [W] That's a good point.
00:50:00 [W] How does that work?
00:50:01 [W] It's one of the things I do is I do a training course on containerd security and definitely some of my best inspiration has come from a question on that core say hey, how does that work?
00:50:09 [W] Oh that leaves me down a path and you know, there's other places places. Well, you know, you can go to stack Overflow or security stack exchange and try and answer the questions and doing that.
00:50:19 [W] Will lead you to interesting places could even lead to see these the other one.
00:50:23 [W] one. I like personally is I got to get a big issues right go to kubernative issues list filter by security just start reading the issues finding out what people are thinking about security and again that can lead to interesting places or even see these
00:50:36 [W] I'm also a big fan of reading GitHub issues and not just in the kubernative repository various kinds of dependencies different kinds of third-party components can have interesting questions that are positive there too because not everybody necessarily
00:50:51 [W] Looks like a security bug but often other bugs can be security bugs.
00:50:55 [W] So sometimes if you read between the lines in different kinds of issues of people being like I found this weird problem, what's up with that?
00:51:01 [W] Sometimes you can find interesting things there.
00:51:03 [W] I also really enjoyed reading the docks.
00:51:05 [W] A lot of project documentation can have interesting phrases in it. Like this can provoke unexpected Behavior.
00:51:12 [W] Do not use this in production.
00:51:13 [W] Please make sure to change these insecure defaults and things like that that when I see that I'm like that's interesting.
00:51:20 [W] NG what does this mean?
00:51:22 [W] And then I want to go Jason and poke at it inspiration can be found from all kinds of places. And personally, I'm excited about that unexpected behavior and those intersections and Corner cases of like what you don't think you're going to find but do so.
00:51:35 [W] Those are a lot of the time the things that I look for.
00:51:39 [W] Yeah curiosity.
00:51:40 [W] Definitely.
00:51:41 [W] I'm fortunate in that I always get to see a fair number of different setups and there's always something I haven't seen before. So I like to use that opportunity to get my hands on it. I have to see it running get it working and then sort
00:51:57 [W] Take survey of what it needs is the assumptions and design decisions that were made especially around those defaults. But I don't like sobbing there. You know, that might be you know job done, but that's where I think the fun just starts so I go right it poking and prodding.
00:52:12 [W] Trying to knock it over mess with its inputs and really see how it handles things when I'm really giving it things that it wasn't expecting. So all the time asking what if I do this what if I do that what if I give it that too much too little if I take that out like what
00:52:27 [W] Savior emerges so like a few months ago.
00:52:29 [W] I was poking at a container image manifest.
00:52:31 [W] Let's just take it out the digester like modifying the URL to fetch a layer from somewhere else and that just ended up triggering a CV in a container runtime.
00:52:40 [W] you know things like that that just kind of pop out of that immersion behavior is really where I like to go to dive in and get my hands dirty on.
00:52:48 [W] So we all have unique takes on how we find new things. But like what's an area that you all think is right for further hacking and exportation.
00:52:58 [W] Yeah, you know I think going back to like how we're changing things, you know, like how things are changed under containerd containerd orchestration.
00:53:04 [W] There is a ton of space that we haven't really spent a ton of time with yet. Right as we think about the way that we're building that isolation model, you know giving each process its own network news Pace or file system those sorts of things.
00:53:17 [W] This is actually implemented by container runtimes and there are several popular container runtimes that makes you wonder like are they all operating the same?
00:53:27 [W] Were they all designed with the same set of assumptions?
00:53:30 [W] I think if there's like a pretty rich space in those sorts of assumptions also things like system calls, right?
00:53:39 [W] Like I was talking about earlier with Falco watching at the Cisco layer to understand what's happening.
00:53:44 [W] The mapping of syscalls is different on the based on the architecture that you use so it would be different for x86 64 then it would be forearm and and I do think that like, you know in those models where we like make the assumption that perhaps we should be only operating under the
00:53:59 [W] Up.
00:53:59 [W] That's under x6c.
00:54:01 [W] x86 64 but this is now running on arm. So is it you know, are we still are we seeing a difference in Behavior those sorts of assumptions?
00:54:09 [W] I think really definitely highlight, you know a whole field of area the play with
00:54:15 [W] I think for me is all about these layers and all the different assumptions are being built up as we stopped over more and more layers, you know from the colonel up through Docker through kubenetes into things like servicemeshcon where those layers meet you get these kind of possibilities for
00:54:30 [W] you're sharp edges Corner cases stuff that could be followed and we're implementing a lot of protocols that are historically complicated things like HTTP, they're being security bugs of HTTP servers for decades now and also pki, you know kubernative makes a lot of
00:54:45 [W] CPI is traditionally a complex thing that has had a lot of security issues.
00:54:48 [W] So those are the kind of areas.
00:54:50 [W] I think are good in particular.
00:54:52 [W] I think where we ever see a new layer. So every new layer has a time to settle down and to work out what security looks like.
00:54:58 [W] So at the moment something like operators, you know, it's quite a new thing.
00:55:01 [W] It's there's a lot of activity there is a lot of development. So there's probably going to be opportunities to you know to poke at it some more and it's an area.
00:55:08 [W] think I'm probably more interested, you know over the next 12 months or so.
00:55:12 [W] Yeah for me. I've noticed a growing number of projects that are extending the kubernative API with custom resources. And that's to do things like create more clusters and even as like a new abstraction for managing other Cloud resources, and I think
00:55:28 [W] Anytime you give the data plane of one environment enough access and permissions to be the control plane of another environment.
00:55:35 [W] I think that's where things can really get interesting when those those layers intersect.
00:55:41 [W] Pressure and yeah, continuing the ongoing theme of layers, you know containers security is a holistic thing, right? Your container security is only as good as the security of the rest of your stack and for me thinking about the way that the
00:55:56 [W] Front parts of the stack cataract present a lot of exciting often unexplored attack surface.
00:56:00 [W] I'm really excited about Hardware attacks. I think Michael architectural techs are really interesting like meltdown inspector and their variants and I think that there is a lot of unexplored territory about how that can interact with things like multi-tenancy in the cloud.
00:56:14 [W] I'm also really excited one layer above about EPF as an attack surface.
00:56:20 [W] think that that is a very interesting unexplored territory where there's a lot of fun things that we haven't quite done yet.
00:56:25 [W] Yet so I feel excited about exploring that coming up and and just getting to explore all of the things because I think the cloud native space in general is so new.
00:56:38 [W] We're all exploring and building this stuff together.
00:56:40 [W] There's parts of the attack surface.
00:56:41 [W] We don't even know are there yet Perhaps because it hasn't been invented.
00:56:45 [W] So I'm super excited to be here at coupon Cloud knative con with everybody getting to build this future together and these Technologies together and I want to say thank you to all of you for
00:56:56 [W] Being here in building and exploring these features with us. If you want to be further involved in the kubernative project or the security of it.
00:57:06 [W] there's lots of work in kubernative to do and in the cncf landscape in general kubernative and a lot of these projects are open source.
00:57:13 [W] there's lots of work to be done. Lots of interesting problems to solve if you want to get involved kubernative has lots of special interest groups Sig's that do lots of different kinds of work.
00:57:23 [W] I'm the co-chair of security.
00:57:25 [W] We have lots of interesting problems to solve and we would love for you to get further involved. If you're interested. If you want to ask us questions or talk to us further, we're around you can find us on kubernative slack or discuss that k8s dot IO and we would love to be able to talk to you all and
00:57:41 [W] We're in a few together.
00:57:43 [W] Indeed and I also wanted to highlight again that like a lot of the questions that we answered during this am a panel came from the community and I wanted to give a shout out to everybody in the community who took the time to ask us your questions for this panel.
00:57:56 [W] We could not do this without your help.
00:57:59 [W] So thank you so much for putting up questions.
00:58:03 [W] And one more thing called the pilot Planet.
00:58:17 [W] Well, thank you Honker.
00:58:19 [W] I just thought the proper terminology.
00:58:20 [W] Thank you panel.
00:58:23 [W] I hope everyone will can't slack everyone seems to be really enjoying this panels of don't forget to else give this feedback on the content on the format. We really want to hear it's a sport for everyone.
00:58:33 [W] And also thank yous panel speakers those amazing amount of work of preparation and amazing delivery now for our next speakers.
00:58:40 [W] I want to introduce grad Shipley and Marissa Bush Grant is a senior director of developer experience at VMware. And Marissa is a program lead for the kubeacademy at VMware today.
00:58:52 [W] They will highlight how the community can advance knowledge of kubernative from getting started use cases all the way to Advanced deployments. Please welcome Grant and Marissa.
00:59:13 [W] Hello everyone.
00:59:14 [W] My name is Grant Shipley and I'm a senior director at VMware focused on kubernative as I'm down in my basement recording this short little keynote presentation.
00:59:24 [W] My kids are upstairs doing what most kids are doing today and that's online learning and that's what I'm here to talk to you about today. But let's start with the numbers now five years.
00:59:34 [W] Ago was the first-ever cube Khan and I was fortunate enough to be able to attend it during that conference.
00:59:40 [W] We had 510 attendees.
00:59:42 [W] Let's fast forward to 2020 to this specific event, and we have over 25,000 people registered and attending Cube con this year.
00:59:54 [W] We have been moving extremely fast during the last five years kubenetes has been adopted as the default platform for cloud native applications going forward and if you believe some of the numbers and analysts this was according to the IDC
01:00:09 [W] Future scape survey 500 million new applications will be developed over the next five years that is more than the last 40 years combined now the challenge with that though.
01:00:22 [W] is that according to stack overflows recent state of development survey 42% of all developers have less than five years of experience.
01:00:32 [W] so we need to be able to ensure that we embracing these new people into the community as they come up to speed.
01:00:39 [W] Don kubernative and that we have the tools and knowledge to be successful now VMware, we have a lot of kubernative.
01:01:09 [W] Turn it over to Marissa who's going to update you on some of the work that we have going on right now at VMware.
01:01:16 [W] Thanks Grant on the topic of making online learning better.
01:01:20 [W] I want to highlight kubeacademy.
01:01:21 [W] kubeacademy offers free online kubenetes training anyone can go to kubeacademy.com to take courses designed and delivered by experts. The course library is always expanding but right now we have 20 courses and more hours of training.
01:01:37 [W] Then the entire series of schitt's Creek.
01:01:41 [W] To give you a taste for the courses.
01:01:43 [W] Here's a great starting point for beginners.
01:01:45 [W] If you're new to kubernative East we recommend taking these three courses in order to help build your foundational knowledge.
01:01:53 [W] For those of you with a more intermediate skill level we have courses that will help get you ready for the CK exam.
01:01:59 [W] Of course that will walk you through options to get observability and your applications and systems. Of course that dives into kubenetes object types and many more
01:02:11 [W] We even have courses for experts to you can dive into the world of networking to understand the kubernative network model learn the design principles and components of the kubernative machine and get Hands-On with command line operations for Kube cuddle.
01:02:27 [W] You can even sign up for kubeacademy Pro for free to get interact to get access to interactive workshops and more in-depth content.
01:02:37 [W] These courses are led by the same individuals that are contributing to kubenetes and related open source projects.
01:02:43 [W] They're sharing what they've learned from hundreds of kubenetes deployments.
01:02:47 [W] And of course, they're creating these trainings for you.
01:02:49 [W] So they're always curious to hear which topics you would like them to cover next.
01:02:55 [W] If you're looking to contribute your own knowledge, you can join the faculty use this QR code to access an application form to become a cube Academy instructor.
01:03:07 [W] So if you're looking to advance your knowledge of kubenetes, you can go to kubeacademy.com today to start your first course.
01:03:17 [W] This can be any continues to lift each other up and sharing our knowledge is part of how we drive Kuma nineties and the cloud native ecosystem forward.
01:03:26 [W] And with that, thank you so much and enjoy the rest of Uconn.
01:03:35 [W] Thank you. Grant and Marissa, I think arguably the probably isn't such a thing as too little s**** Creek at least, you know, Nancy Stephen are pretty biased towards that but thank you for sharing that.
01:03:49 [W] Okay. Kubeacademy sounds really wonderful now our next presenter she'll is very familiar to all of you Liz rice Liz is a cncf Toc chair and vice president of open-source engineering at Aqua Security today.
01:04:03 [W] Give an update on the cloud native communities progress and where we might go from here for the per second perspective of the technical oversight committee Toc please welcome Liz rice.
01:04:33 [W] Hi, my name is Liz Wright, and I'm the chair of the cncf technical oversight committee.
01:04:40 [W] We're the group that steer the technical direction of the foundation and assess projects that apply to join or move up through sandbox and incubation to graduated level.
01:04:53 [W] This gives us a vantage point to see interesting Trends emerging from the cloud native world.
01:05:01 [W] So I want to take a few minutes today to talk about some of the changes. We want to focus on over the next year or so and share some predictions about the up-and-coming technology areas.
01:05:13 [W] We think will get more attention in 2021 and Beyond.
01:05:20 [W] This year we revamp the sandbox process making it much easier for projects to join at that level.
01:05:27 [W] But with the understanding that this is a space for experimentation and early stage collaboration.
01:05:34 [W] So here's our first prediction for 2021.
01:05:38 [W] We expect to see some sandbox projects failing and others consolidating or merging with other projects. This is an entirely healthy thing.
01:05:50 [W] If the cncf is going to support and encourage innovation in the cloud knative space, we have to expect some of the experiments to fail.
01:05:58 [W] Upon coming technology areas.
01:06:00 [W] we think will get more attention in 2021 and Beyond.
01:06:07 [W] This year we revamp the sandbox process making it much easier for projects to join at that level.
01:06:14 [W] But with the understanding that this is a space for experimentation and early stage collaboration.
01:06:22 [W] So here's our first prediction for 2021.
01:06:25 [W] We expect to see some sandbox projects failing and others consolidating or merging with other projects. This is an entirely healthy thing.
01:06:37 [W] If the cncf is going to support and encourage innovation in the cloud native space, we have to expect some of these experiments to fail.
01:06:45 [W] In fact, if all our sandbox projects make it to incubation that would suggest we haven't been experimental enough.
01:06:53 [W] Let's keep Cloud native innovative.
01:06:58 [W] At the other end of the maturity spectrum is graduation.
01:07:02 [W] A graduated project is one that we believe is ready for widespread adoption with little risk to an Enterprise that chooses to take it on.
01:07:14 [W] The current graduation criteria were drawn up at a time when moving to Cloud knative was a pretty cutting-edge thing for an Enterprise to do now we're seeing much wider adoption and we have many more
01:08:01 [W] knative innovative
01:08:04 [W] at the other end of the maturity spectrum is graduation.
01:08:08 [W] I graduated project is one that we believe is ready for widespread adoption with little risk to an Enterprise that chooses to take it on.
01:08:20 [W] The current graduation criteria were drawn up at a time when moving to Cloud knative was a pretty cutting-edge thing for an Enterprise to do now we're seeing much wider adoption and we have many more
01:08:35 [W] Sense for the TOC to take a look at the way we assess projects at incubation and graduation to make sure these definitions stay meaningful for everyone.
01:08:46 [W] We're absolutely sticking with the principles of no King makers and one size does not fit all but we think that as a community we can do an even better job of highlighting the best Solutions in
01:09:01 [W] Acres and one size does not fit all but we think that as a community we can do an even better job of highlighting the best Solutions in Cloud native and helping end users identify, which
01:09:19 [W] And helping end users identify which project is best for their particular circumstances.
01:09:27 [W] This also includes making sure that project governance is confidence inspiring as ever.
01:09:34 [W] We're not proposing to impose any particular form of governance. But we do want to provide advice and support for project leaders who might want help in this complex area.
01:09:47 [W] So another prediction the cncf will be able to provide additional support and ideas for governance models that work for contributors and users are like let's keep Cloud native well-governed.
01:10:04 [W] I feel on pretty safe ground on this next prediction.
01:10:07 [W] The number of projects involved will grow there will continue to be a ton of innovation and we'll see more community-driven collaborative projects joining the cncf +
01:10:23 [W] includes lots of vendors building complementary projects in the cloud knative space
01:10:22 [W] So that's cncf landscape.
01:10:24 [W] I'm looking forward to some downtime over the Christmas holidays with a nice jigsaw puzzle folks like to joke about the cncf landscape and how you need a microscope to read it, but in all seriousness
01:10:39 [W] Folks like to Jake about the cncf landscape and how you need a microscope to read it.
01:10:43 [W] But in all seriousness, there are lots of people who find it useful especially in its online form to find out about projects that might help solve a particular problem they have
01:10:57 [W] but I think we can do better to help users find their way around their options for a cloud native stack.
01:11:06 [W] I think I'm speaking not just for the TOC but also for the cncf staff when I say that creative ideas on this are welcome.
01:11:16 [W] So far I've talked about how we operate as an organization and a community, but now let's focus on the technology, which is what we get really excited about right working with my talented colleagues on the TOC.
01:11:31 [W] We came up with five emerging themes and technologies that we think are ones to watch in 2021.
01:11:39 [W] in no particular order
01:11:43 [W] we're seeing projects aiming to make resilience and Chaos engine earring easy to incorporate in your deployments.
01:11:51 [W] When your applications use many pluggable and Loosely coupled components, it's hard to test the resilience of the overall system.
01:12:00 [W] It seems likely that in the not-too-distant future.
01:12:03 [W] It will be common practice to use chaosmesh engineering to test how your applications handle failure scenarios and unexpected events.
01:12:13 [W] While many ngos is today are running their kubernative clusters.
01:12:17 [W] Holy located in data centers or the public Cloud.
01:12:22 [W] We're seeing more and more applications where notes or entire clusters operate at a physical distance.
01:12:29 [W] We are now hosting projects that explore various different models for running components distributed at the edge.
01:12:38 [W] It won't stop at orchestration will need other cloudevents.
01:12:43 [W] Knative components for the edge too.
01:12:47 [W] servicemeshcon
01:13:12 [W] webassembly Andy BPF will be hot Technologies in 2021.
01:13:18 [W] Well, those are essentially unrelated. They share some interesting characteristics like sandboxing high performance and customization the make them really applicable for use in solutions to a range of
01:13:33 [W] We're expecting to see a proliferation of projects to address the developer and operator experience.
01:13:37 [W] We need to make workflows that easier and allow developers to free themselves from the implementation details like yeah, Milland gitops.
01:13:49 [W] There's unlikely to be a single user experience that fits every use case.
01:13:54 [W] So we are fans of pluggable dashboards and extensible API driven you eyes we're seeing developer portals that make it easy to share common practices and tooling across organizations
01:14:09 [W] Schools built on top of Cloud native Technologies to take the idea of an integrated development environment to a whole new level and lower the barrier to contribution.
01:13:57 [W] I hope all the VCS and analysts have been taking notes.
01:14:00 [W] There's plenty of work to be done outside these areas.
01:14:05 [W] Do you remember two years ago in Seattle Janet quo described kubernative as very boring
01:14:13 [W] And she didn't mean that working on it was boring.
01:14:16 [W] She meant that it had moved into the mainstream.
01:14:20 [W] That's happening to more and more of our projects as they become mature and get adopted by lots of large organizations.
01:14:29 [W] There's tons of exciting and interesting work to be done to move Cloud native projects into the mainstream and keep Cloud native everywhere.
01:14:48 [W] Thank you, Liz.
01:14:49 [W] Let's give her a round of applause now. Our next speaker is Chris an effect.
01:14:57 [W] So I want everyone to welcome Chris Anna check the CTO of the Linux Foundation to present the cncf maintainer and Ambassador words of 2020.
01:15:05 [W] Hey everyone.
01:15:04 [W] It's a pleasure to be here live in Austin.
01:15:06 [W] It's just been amazing to have 23,000 people attending Cube con this time around.
01:15:13 [W] This is truly one of my favorite, you know activities for the conference, you know towards the tail end of this.
01:15:22 [W] Let me go to share my screen really quick so we can get started with the awards.
01:15:37 [W] Alrighty, so I am you know absolutely stoked to present these every year. It's been truly an honor to serve this community for the last five years really since you know Day Zero.
01:15:52 [W] I was talking to everyone, you know, slack Twitter and all these different communication mediums.
01:15:42 [W] You know, it really kind of dawned on me that you know Community is truly a precious thing.
01:15:49 [W] You know, I saw this tweet from Leia that you know, jokingly at most valuable conative Foundation project is our community and I somewhat agree.
01:15:57 [W] There's so many folks that do an amazing job ensuring that our community is welcome.
01:16:01 [W] Well above and beyond normal normal day-to-day.
01:16:06 [W] Leti so I'm just you know, totally share this sentiment and you know, thank everyone that goes above and beyond in making sure this is a welcome Place given especially how much we have grown over the years to encompassed different projects different
01:16:21 [W] Different countries and everything so it's kind of kick things off.
01:16:20 [W] Our first award to hand out is our top ambassador award.
01:16:26 [W] Our ambassadors are folks who represent, you know, the community and public through giving talks organizing events and so on if you see the previous list of Award winners here, we truly have
01:16:41 [W] Of an amazing set of folks from you know, Kelsey being the OG ambassador to Lucas if it was maybe like 17 at the time when he won that award to Sarah Michael and Lappy all these fantastic people for this time around.
01:16:49 [W] I'm excited that you know, the top Ambassador for 2020 is an amazing person.
01:16:58 [W] They have been promoting the you know, it's called The Art of improving climate of security across our
01:17:06 [W] System throughout the last couple years, so I would like to congratulate in cold water on winning this award this year.
01:17:17 [W] So hopefully we could go pop out and see her really quickly and she could leave.
01:17:36 [W] and
01:17:39 [W] oh, no.
01:17:40 [W] Alright, we had a bug.
01:17:46 [W] Joy
01:17:58 [W] We will move on wonderful intrado giving us wonderful issues today.
01:18:02 [W] So let's keep on rollin with our roads.
01:18:06 [W] Thank you negate they have been an amazing Ambassador for us also.
01:18:14 [W] Let's do it again.
01:18:17 [W] All right.
01:18:18 [W] we're back.
01:18:22 [W] I thank you again.
01:18:26 [W] All right. Our next set of awards are dedicated to top committers and maintainers.
01:18:33 [W] These are folks who have put forth and done an amazing job in the community in terms of supporting projects that are involved and we just have a fantastic set of folks that span the mid-eighties Prometheus in a variety of projects this year the
01:18:48 [W] Maintainer is existing containers have nominated a set of folks and decided to award the special honor to an elder from the communities Community.
01:19:00 [W] Not sure if any of you know been one of the primary authors of kind tool that I love and use quite quite often and is just one of the most helpful people in the community answering a variety of questions.
01:19:11 [W] So, let's see if we could pop up then onto our screen.
01:19:15 [W] All right.
01:19:18 [W] Hey, Ben. Alright now we're going to technical glitches are over get to see puppy and head.
01:19:24 [W] head. So, thank you Ben and thanks for all your contributions.
01:19:28 [W] All right, bring it back to our Awards.
01:19:33 [W] Sheriff perfect.
01:19:35 [W] Awesome.
01:19:35 [W] We're back.
01:19:36 [W] Thank you Ben our final set of awards which I think you know kind of our most important set of awards truly represent one of our values the most important values in the
01:19:51 [W] Chopping wood and carrying water for those of you who are not familiar phrase.
01:19:48 [W] These are essentially all the things that happen, you know behind the scenes from things like improving, you know, build times, you know performance generally not kind of feature facing work truly stuff that kind of keeps everything functional.
01:20:02 [W] We just had an amazing set of folks that have contributed over time in this and this year.
01:20:08 [W] year. I'm happy to announce our next slate of folks that have been nominated.
01:20:14 [W] Voted upon by both the cncf staff and our wonderful Toc so for 2020 we have Aaron Boyd Josh burkas Bridget, Matt and Richie, you know all fantastic human beings and
01:20:30 [W] On screen hopefully with their wonderful chop wood buckets and or it's good to see everybody loved it.
01:20:29 [W] Richie's the best.
01:20:30 [W] Yeah.
01:20:30 [W] So thank you everyone for all your work. And you know, I look forward to when we were able to see each other again face to face because truly all of you deserve to be on stage with over 20,000 people watching keynote also
01:20:45 [W] You know wrap wrap things up, you know, you know, I look forward to seeing everyone at the next Cube Khan and thank you for everyone who has participated in our communities. We do these awards every year and
01:20:56 [W] Do our best to make sure that folks that are welcome and do amazing things are recognized for their amazing work.
01:21:01 [W] So thank you all and look forward to seeing everyone next year. I'm gonna go hand it back to constants and Stephen to take us the end.
01:21:18 [W] Thank you, Chris.
01:21:19 [W] Thank you. Everyone for joining us this week Carol. I like do the puppy face before he walks away because he's not taking it anywhere. And I know he wants to sleep.
01:21:31 [W] There's like too much screen time.
01:21:32 [W] like I can't handle is popular, please everyone stop giving me all this attention on the internet. I direct a lot of it adoration. I'm going to share this quick anecdote before we actually do the official wrapping up Kota.
01:21:46 [W] Is known for ignoring people and so every time if you're to meet him in person, he will ignore you.
01:21:50 [W] So what he likes to do is he likes to maintain eye contact smile at you and as you pet goat a pet him, he does a 180 and purposely walks away.
01:21:57 [W] So like this attend like this Fame just gets to his head. It's really dangerous for both of us.
01:22:02 [W] But anyways, so while we wish we could have all been together in person.
01:22:08 [W] It's a fortunate situation that we're still able to come together, even if it's virtually so I want to thank everyone for participating in Twitter watching talk so many anynines.
01:22:16 [W] Recording talks.
01:22:14 [W] We know that if released from our personal experience.
01:22:18 [W] It is very hard to participate in this and so thank you everyone for putting in the energy and now I know of course because you know, we're all planning for the next one our next virtual Cuca knative Khan will be in Europe.
01:22:30 [W] It will be the year of chapter is happening May 4th through May 7th, 2021, and the cfps are open now.
01:22:37 [W] And so they're now please submit we want to see more cfps, and they're open until December 13th and sponsorships are still available.
01:22:47 [W] So I think you know by now that I really really love the community. One of my favorite parts of this conference is getting to see the community Awards.
01:22:58 [W] So just wanted to reiterate the shout out to everyone who who won an award everyone who is doing phenomenal work for all of the cloud native projects. You are my friends and family and I'm happy to work with all of you every day
01:23:13 [W] Is now join the keynote speakers within the keynote slack channel. So that's 2 Cube con Keynotes and we'll be hanging out for the next 15 minutes or so to answer any questions that you may have had.
01:23:22 [W] had. I know there's been like really wonderful this course throughout and lots of like high fives and waves and anecdotes and thank you, okay.
01:23:32 [W] And honkin ha ha ha.
01:23:37 [W] So the last set of breakout sessions will begin at through 10:00 eastern time.
01:23:43 [W] Yeah, and that's that's almost it.
01:23:46 [W] That's all right.
01:23:47 [W] Thank you for yeah. Thank you for joining us.
01:23:50 [W] Yeah.
01:23:51 [W] Thank you everyone.
01:23:59 [W] Our job is to make kubernative easier and easier and easier to use either from an Ops point of view or developer point of view while acknowledging it is complex because we're solving a complex problem.
01:24:58 [W] Kubernative will be boring as soon as we can make it boring.
01:25:01 [W] Maybe after I retire it's already boring.
01:25:05 [W] So I think we're well on our journey towards kubernative being boring.
01:25:08 [W] It'll only be boring when it's done.
01:25:10 [W] It'll only be done when it's no longer relevant.
01:28:47 [W] our job is to make kubermatic easier and easier and easier to use either from an Ops point of view or developer point of view while acknowledging it is complex because
01:28:56 [W] We're solving a complex problem.
01:29:57 [W] Kubernative will be boring as soon as we can make it boring.
01:30:00 [W] Maybe after I retire it's already boring.
01:30:03 [W] So I think we're well on our journey towards kubernative being boring.
01:30:07 [W] It'll only be boring when it's done.
01:30:09 [W] It'll only be done when it's no longer relevant.
04:26:23 [W0] Hey everyone. My name is Christina is like I'm super excited to be.
04:26:56 [W1] Everyone, my name is Kristina is like I'm super excited to be here today to present the community towards this is truly one of my favorite activities of the year when it comes to cncf we have so many amazing community members all over the world
04:27:11 [W1] day in a tireless way to you know, improve the state of the things and you know, as I kind of look back on, you know my role, you know, kind of been with cncf since day Zero it's been over five years now and I think one thing that I reflect on you
04:27:26 [W1] Five years now, and I think one thing that I reflect on, you know is you know Community truly is precious.
04:27:30 [W1] There is this tweet that caught my attention from a Committee Member Leia that you know, kind of jokingly said that you know, the most valuable cncf project is our community and you know, I completely agree like the
04:27:46 [W1] Out there that you know serve, you know tirelessly helping folks out is amazing and something that I just completely blows me away every every day. So without you know any further Ado I'd like to go and start our process to introduce our
04:28:00 [W1] Every day, so without any further Ado I'd like to go and start our process to introduce our three main awards for today.
04:28:08 [W1] First up is our ambassador award.
04:28:12 [W1] So this kind of reflects, you know, people who go out and publicly speak spreading, you know, the claim clown admission educating people about projects or Community hosting events doing all sorts of things that just benefit the whole ecosystem
04:28:27 [W1] Doing all sorts of things that just benefit the whole ecosystem.
04:28:30 [W1] If you look at the previous winners of this award we have you know, Kelsey Hightower or OG Ambassador, you know Lucas who you know, I believe one this is when he was like 17 venerable Sarah Novotny Michael and Lackey who are just fantastic people have done so much.
04:28:45 [W1] To you know, get the cloud native message out there and so for 2020, you know this Community member, you know, they have been quite phenomenal phenomenal.
04:28:55 [W1] I've been following them on Twitter for a while, especially around security related things and in cognitive and super stoked to announce today that Ian cold water has won the top ambassador award for 2020.
04:29:10 [W1] Aztec job spreading Colonnade of security practices and in general just making things fun and approachable for everyone.
04:29:14 [W1] So congratulations Ian and glad to you know, have you win the award this year?

00:00:00 [W] Kubernative will be boring as soon as we can make it boring.
00:00:03 [W] Maybe after I retire it's already boring.
00:00:06 [W] So I think we're well on our journey towards kubernative being boring.
00:00:10 [W] It'll only be boring when it's done.
00:00:12 [W] It'll only be done when it's no longer relevant.
00:00:53 [W] It'll only be boring when it's done.
00:00:56 [W] It'll only be done when it's no longer relevant.
00:01:54 [W] Our job is to make kubernative easier and easier and easier to use either from an Ops point of view or developer point of view while acknowledging it is complex because we're solving a complex problem.
00:05:45 [W] Kubernative will be boring as soon as we can make it boring.
00:05:48 [W] Maybe after I retire.
00:05:51 [W] It's already boring.
00:05:52 [W] So I think we're well on our journey towards kubernative being boring.
00:05:55 [W] It'll only be boring when it's done.

00:07:33 [W] Hello everyone and welcome to day 3 or day for depending if you do index starting at 1 or 0 to Coke on North America 2020 in the last set of key notes.
00:07:42 [W] Really well, and so to validate my assumption, please do the round of applause for everyone over the past few days both in terms of kolos events and Keynotes and amazing presentations.
00:07:39 [W] And so to start off the first keynote of the day.
00:07:44 [W] we are going to be hearing from the lovely my lovely co-chair Steven Steven Augustus, you know, you should probably should be familiar to you by now. He is a senior open source engineer of VMware and today
00:07:58 [W] say he will discuss slowing down the release Cadence of kubernative with a more deliberate not deliverable deliberate approach, please welcome back Steve and Augustus and let's give him a round of applause and Slack
00:08:20 [W] Hello.
00:08:21 [W] Hello everyone.
00:08:23 [W] My name is Steven Augustus. And I am one of your co-chairs for Kube con Cloud native con and a virtual 2020 when I'm not reviewing your lovely Toc submissions or putting
00:08:38 [W] black
00:08:38 [W] hello.
00:08:39 [W] Hello everyone.
00:08:40 [W] My name is Steven Augustus. And I'm one of your co-chairs for Kube con Cloud native con and a virtual 2020 when I'm not reviewing your lovely Toc submissions or putting
00:09:16 [W] A program for what?
00:09:18 [W] I truly believe is one of the best conferences in the world.
00:09:21 [W] I am a senior open source engineer at VMware now it's in the title, but let's go a little deeper on the open-source bits.
00:09:33 [W] My day-to-day is spending time in a open source project that is near and dear to my heart and you may have heard of it.
00:09:43 [W] It's called kubernative.
00:09:46 [W] So today I wanted to take some time to talk to you a little bit about the kubernative A's project and more specifically the release cycle for the kubernetes project now.
00:10:02 [W] In the community I serve as a co-chair for Sig release as well as one of the senior release managers now what that means is honestly I have I have the opportunity to interface with
00:10:16 [W] I have the opportunity to interface with a bunch of lovely people to manage a group of rock stars.
00:10:20 [W] really. So I wanted to I wanted to give you a little bit of their view into the release cycle and some of the discussions that we've had across 2020.
00:10:36 [W] Now something interesting happened in 2020, and I'm not sure that it has happened to frequently if at all in the project and that's we slow down. We slow down the release Cadence during
00:10:51 [W] The 119 release and we did it. Deliberately.
00:10:56 [W] We did it to give an opportunity for people to to really live through the the 2020 of it all and in making that decision it was it was not about technology.
00:11:12 [W] It's 20 of it all and in making that decision it was it was not about technology.
00:11:15 [W] It's very much.
00:11:16 [W] So about the the people I think it's going to ring true as you as you view the talks across the week that the the contributors maintainers of the kubernetes project very deeply care about the
00:11:32 [W] The people who work on the project the people who consume what we produce every day.
00:11:40 [W] Now one of the interesting questions that was asked as we slow down the release Cadence The Slowdown of the release Cadence resulted in what will be only three releases for the
00:11:55 [W] For the 2020 calendar year and the question was?
00:12:00 [W] Is this permanent?
00:12:02 [W] Is that something that's going to continue to happen right now?
00:12:06 [W] We have a set of folks that are that are of differing opinions and I was interested in getting some feedback here and kind of coalescing all of that into one place now.
00:12:21 [W] Decided to do something incredibly scientific and I started a Twitter poll to ask would you prefer three releases are for for the year?
00:12:27 [W] And I got some great responses.
00:12:29 [W] I got some really really great responses some well-thought-out one some funny ones as well as offering options, like releasing releasing twice a year releasing once a year talking about LTS,
00:12:45 [W] On a nightly basis releasing on a weekly basis, right? So lots of different options to consider and layered onto those options is what is best for
00:12:57 [W] Unity what is best for the people who have to produce kubernative what is best for the people who are Downstream contributor contributors to Downstream projects?
00:13:05 [W] What are the what are the trade-offs for end user communities that need to consume kubernative?
00:13:14 [W] What are the trade-offs for vendors cloud cloud providers that are interested in consuming kubernative.
00:13:21 [W] Zar published distributions.
00:13:22 [W] s of kubernative
00:13:25 [W] Now I'm going to kind of rapid-fire some of the feedback that was given, but firstly I'll say that there was overwhelming support for three releases as opposed to four for the year.
00:13:40 [W] Now one of the things that I consider as as one of the co-chairs of Sig release is the overhead to actually crank the wheel that is that is kubernative, right?
00:13:55 [W] a a minor release of kubenetes and and part of that is is communication a huge part of that is communication usually affectionately call the the incoming release team lead the
00:14:09 [W] Cat herder of the group. The release team is a group of somewhere between at any one cycle 25 and 40 people and 40 people now all of those people
00:14:13 [W] one we have to recruit those people to all of those people are responsible for delivering delivering feedback from the various cigs sub-projects component areas
00:14:26 [W] It's back into Sig release so that we can get an accurate picture of what's happening for right now the quarter and and maybe maybe later something different in terms of cadence.
00:14:38 [W] So one of the big things I consider is is the overhead to actually spin up a team every cycle right that takes that takes at least two weeks if we're if we're doing it quickly and a little more
00:14:53 [W] Lee spin up a team every cycle right that takes that takes at least two weeks if we're if we're doing it quickly and a little more if we're considering holidays feedback
00:15:10 [W] Ring holidays feedback reaching out to people doing interviews.
00:15:15 [W] So on and so forth.
00:15:16 [W] So that's one component of it.
00:15:18 [W] The other another component is the release engineering tooling right? So some of the release engineering tooling that we use today has been in place from close to the Inception of the project, right?
00:15:32 [W] So considerations around how we build functionality into new sets of tools.
00:15:40 [W] And how we start to spin down the old right the goal being that the new tools are more sustainable more likely to have to attract contributors to our group.
00:15:54 [W] group. So on and so forth, right?
00:15:56 [W] So also considering data so Sig cluster lifecycle recently had a survey where the data does support that people would be interested in future releases now, why
00:16:12 [W] Polly to have to attract contributors to our group so on and so forth, right?
00:16:19 [W] So also considering data so Sig cluster lifecycle recently had a survey where the data does support that people would be interested in in future releases now, why
00:16:50 [W] I think I think kind of with the 2020 theme but also every other year people are struggling to keep up now as a former former field
00:17:05 [W] Architect at Cloud native leaders like Coral s and red hat. I've had the opportunity to see up close what users have to deal with as they consider moving to kubernative
00:17:20 [W] What users have to deal with as they consider moving to kubernative a sore upgrading kubernative A's and and the kind of the kind of work that's involved there from a company perspective.
00:17:33 [W] Of the kind of work that's involved there from a company perspective as well as the work that needs to not happen in order for that to happen moving moving
00:17:48 [W] As well as the work that needs to not happen in order for that to happen moving moving to New infrastructure means that you spend less time on building building for for stability.
00:18:03 [W] Means that you spend less time building and deploying features, right? So that's something to consider from the end user perspective as well.
00:18:11 [W] now
00:18:13 [W] For for users, at least one of those release cycles that we have for the year.
00:18:20 [W] Their focus is is you know is pointing somewhere else, right and it's as I mentioned whether it's delivering features delivering stability for their internal platforms applications and again something that
00:18:35 [W] To consider now something that I love that happened towards the end of the 119 really cycle is that we had an extended code freeze and we had an extended.
00:18:44 [W] hold on thawing in the code essentially making kubernative the kubernative kubernative repo ready to accept merges again, so we have various various tooling that allows us to
00:18:59 [W] To gate merges for on Milestones on whether or not something is approved on whether the tests are failing or not.
00:19:04 [W] And
00:19:05 [W] I saw the opportunity both from the Sig release side from the Sig testing side from a slew of of Sig chair component of project areas in
00:19:21 [W] Areas in improving the way that we test the infrastructure that we test upon and that was a net positive for the project.
00:19:29 [W] So being able to build stability and some more of the processes that we that we care about day to day that we have to kind of live through day-to-day is important as well.
00:19:43 [W] Now some some people brought up the fear of accumulating risk and Technical debt in the project and to be frank with you.
00:19:55 [W] We've already done it.
00:19:57 [W] We've already done it.
00:19:59 [W] We've already done it. So I think this is a good opportunity for us to step back.
00:20:03 [W] Look at open issues. Look at things that are in previous Milestones. Look at things that are targeted for targeted as priority important long-term.
00:20:14 [W] And and think about how to plan out those projects think about how to deliver enhancements in a more sustainable way, right?
00:20:25 [W] So Sig responsibilities things like the API policies the feature graduation changes making it possible for more people to consume kubernative A's releases whether they
00:20:40 [W] It possible for more people to consume kubernative A's releases whether they be pre-releases miners are seized the the patch releases that come out monthly all of that is kind of composed in this.
00:20:55 [W] Ori as well as driving down the the rush to review during code freeze testing very specific things more often and figuring out what all of the downstream implications are for
00:21:10 [W] You day to day so really in closing I would ask you to to be vocal about what you want as we consider changes to the release process have the conversation with us in slack on the
00:21:24 [W] Cross the cigs if you want to reach out via DM and chat about this feel free.
00:21:28 [W] Feel free to come to come to us because we want to make a decision and we want to make a decision considering everyone who's involved whether it be a contributor maintainer Downstream consumer end users Cloud providers.
00:21:42 [W] So come come come and play.
00:21:44 [W] Thank you for your time everyone. Have a good day.
00:21:50 [W] Awesome.
00:21:51 [W] Thank you Stephen.
00:21:52 [W] Let's give him a round of applause and the select Channel especially what I really like about Steven's talk, right?
00:21:58 [W] It's you know, it's an in response to the current times.
00:22:01 [W] Maybe it is a really good opportunity for all of us to reflect upon the you know, the pace of you're working on before covid before all these changes happen to our work life is that you know, maybe we were all burning the candle at both ends and we need you to find a way that's more sustainable.
00:22:17 [W] I really love this message now.
00:22:16 [W] Let's go on to our next set of speakers. Our next presenters are Guinevere Sanger.
00:22:23 [W] Oops.
00:22:23 [W] Sorry going to vary forgot to ask it how to pronounce your name beforehand and Leah Peterson Guinevere. The software engineer at GitHub and Leia is a reliability engineer at to Sigma Investments rating today.
00:22:35 [W] Apparently is very hard for me. Now today, they'll talk about the Ada developers Academy and the work the graduates do please welcome Guinevere and Leah.
00:22:55 [W] Hi everybody.
00:22:56 [W] Thank you for joining us today.
00:23:00 [W] So we're all here at Cube Kong to learn more about Cloud Technologies.
00:23:04 [W] If we could look around the room right now, we would see a huge group of people with different backgrounds and skills all leveraging Cloud Technologies for different reasons.
00:23:16 [W] In fact saying I guess we're all Cloud Engineers now has become a bit of a complaint throughout the industry.
00:23:25 [W] So today we want to talk about who are we building these Cloud Technologies for the computers to make them run faster to make them more reliable.
00:23:35 [W] Why are we doing this?
00:23:36 [W] In general depends on cloud computing more and more especially in these socially distant times.
00:23:36 [W] So as the definition of a cloud user expands we have to make sure we're building tools that help this diverse user base Leverage The Cloud.
00:23:50 [W] So how do we build great tools for a set of users who aren't like us?
00:23:57 [W] We work with a team of developers who aren't like us to build strong tools.
00:24:02 [W] We need engineering teams with many different skills backgrounds and perspectives.
00:24:10 [W] Let's take a look at some Cloud Engineers out there.
00:24:17 [W] Hi, I'm gonna be here as a musician.
00:24:20 [W] I learned to quickly recognize patterns, which now helps me to design and build intuitive to pulley tooling that is easy to use for every engineer at GitHub.
00:24:33 [W] Hello, my name is Leah.
00:24:36 [W] I bring several skills from my previous job as a motorcycle stunt Rider to my role as a reliability engineer today, including breaking down big and sometimes scary problems creating a plan and knowing when to just go for it
00:24:51 [W] Skills have helped me both learn how to do a wheelie and also migrate services to the cloud.
00:24:51 [W] We would also like to highlight two pain who uses her skills breaking down content to speak to people with different experience levels to help her build open source Cloud authentication tools.
00:25:07 [W] As a software engineer at hashicorp to who would support struggling teammates in a constructive way to help her team move forward and resolve conflict, which is a skill that she developed in her previous role managing students teachers and families in a business context.
00:25:24 [W] And finally, I'm only a musician turned software engineer who uses her skills from her eclectic background to build platforms that help Google Cloud users manage their billing and budgets.
00:25:36 [W] It's so what do all of these Engineers have in common you thought I was gonna say kubernative.
00:25:46 [W] It's didn't you in fact, it's that we all learned how to code and got jobs in the tech industry.
00:25:52 [W] Thanks to Ada developers Academy.
00:25:58 [W] Is a developers Academy is a non-profit tuition-free coding school in Seattle aimed at women and gender diverse adults and it has a great social justice mission.
00:26:10 [W] If you're interested in leveraging the Ada Network to bring different perspectives to your engineering team.
00:26:02 [W] There are a few ways you can get involved first. You can sponsor an intern or you could consider hiring a graduate from our ever growing pool of graduates from the Boot Camp or you could support or attend our
00:26:17 [W] I'm conference, which is called a t-con and you can get more information about that at a deacon.com.
00:26:12 [W] So to wrap this up while maybe not everyone is a cloud engineer.
00:26:18 [W] Everyone is in fact a cloud user.
00:26:21 [W] And with that we can say that to keep Cloud native everywhere.
00:26:26 [W] We must work with Engineers that do in fact come from everywhere.
00:26:33 [W] Thank you.
00:26:34 [W] Thank you.
00:26:39 [W] Thank you. Gwen and Leah right like we all especially I got the chance to work with go ahead and lay up for the presentation and you know, it is very true that different backgrounds provide so much more
00:26:54 [W] You know like the interaction right like that.
00:26:53 [W] You learn all these different set of questions to ask and you bring them to your community.
00:26:56 [W] And so it is really wonderful what it is doing and encourage everyone to look into it. Now the next keynote is very exciting Steve for everyone. Mostly because this is the first time we're doing a panel
00:27:11 [W] And so I want to welcome for lovely humans.
00:27:00 [W] Now this consists and there are circuity subject matter experts in cold water Duffy coolly bread Jessamine and Rory McCune Ian is a kubernative Sig co-chair and cncf Ambassador
00:27:15 [W] Hacking and Harden kubernative containers and cloudevents structure.
00:27:17 [W] Duffy is a Solutions architect at Apple.
00:27:20 [W] Brad is co-founder of dark bit and Rory is principal consultant at NC cgroup and a few weeks ago.
00:27:28 [W] They requested questions from the community centered around security and hacking and their unofficial special interest group Sig honk now instead of a normal clap.
00:27:40 [W] I encourage everyone to use the good old Goose. So
00:27:43 [W] please welcome Ian Duffy Brad and Rory with a good old round of goosing in the slack Channel.
00:28:15 [W] Hi, everybody greetings from Sunny Minneapolis where it is just as cold and snowy as it would be in Boston if we were all in the same place, welcome to the Sig honk ask us anything panel at coupon North America 2020 virtual
00:28:31 [W] Official kubernative special interest group.
00:28:25 [W] We are a hacker crew and a group of friends who have been working on various aspects of kubernative security for a long time now and we're super excited to be here. These questions have been brought To Us by the community and thank you all for submitting them.
00:28:36 [W] So thanks for being here with us.
00:28:38 [W] Let's introduce ourselves.
00:28:40 [W] My name is Ian cold water.
00:28:42 [W] I come from a devops turned pentesting background.
00:28:45 [W] I am now the co-chair of kubernative Sig security and the new director of Dessa cups at twilio. I've been hacking on kublr.
00:28:53 [W] Genetics things for about four years now, and I'm super excited to be here.
00:28:58 [W] Hey everyone.
00:28:59 [W] My name is Duffy coolly, and my pronouns are he/him.
00:29:03 [W] I've been playing with networks distributed systems and people in this space for quite a while and I really enjoy making in communities like kubernative like more approachable and and certainly more inclusive. So if you have any questions or anything I can ever do to help just
00:29:19 [W] I'm super excited to be here.
00:29:11 [W] Hey everyone.
00:29:12 [W] My name is Duffy coolly, and my pronouns are he/him.
00:29:16 [W] I've been playing with networks distributed systems and people in this space for quite a while and I really enjoy making in communities like kubernative like more approachable and and certainly more inclusive.
00:29:28 [W] So if you have any questions or anything I can ever do to help just reach out.
00:29:31 [W] I'm happy to do it.
00:29:32 [W] I've recently transitioned to Apple and and now I'm doing some of that work there. So I'm really excited to be here.
00:29:39 [W] Oh my pronouns, are they them to hi everyone. So, my name is Remi.
00:29:43 [W] Kin. My poor nouns are he/him.
00:29:45 [W] I'm a principal consultant at NCI cgroup where I focus mainly on doing security tests and assessments for customers and I be looking containerd security data for about four five years.
00:29:56 [W] I'm Brad giesemann. My pronouns are he/him.
00:29:59 [W] And I'm the co-founder of dark pit a consultancy focused on cloud and kubernetes security posture assessments.
00:30:05 [W] I've been building you hacking on kubernative for almost four years now as well.
00:30:09 [W] And yes, gieselmann is my real last name, but it's no coincidence that I was pretty much born a hunk speaking of that though.
00:30:16 [W] I suppose we should explain what all the honking is about. So the honk thing came from a video game called Untitled Goose game, which was published by a company called house house about a year ago.
00:30:26 [W] In time on total Goose game. The protagonist is a mischievous goose who runs around a pastoral English Village causing trouble on purpose this goose in this game kind of sneaks around and uses seemingly innocuous everyday
00:30:42 [W] Assessments I've been building in hacking on kubernative for almost four years now as well.
00:30:46 [W] yes, gieselmann is my real last name, but it's no coincidence that I was pretty much born honk speaking of that though. I suppose we should explain what all the honking is about.
00:30:57 [W] So the honk thing came from a video game called Untitled Goose game, which was published by a company called house house about a year ago entitled Goose game. The protagonist is a mischievous goose who runs around a pastoral English Village causing trouble on purpose
00:31:46 [W] to chain them together to perhaps do something like exploit them for its own ends because of this because it's kind of like the way hackers do things some of us hackers kind of adopted this Goose as a mascot of sorts and when we talk about honking a lot of the time
00:32:01 [W] About hacking or just causing problems on purpose.
00:32:04 [W] I have a question for you all so we've all been working on kubernative for a minute.
00:32:10 [W] How do you think that the security posture and attack surface has changed with more modern Cloud native text acts over the old way of doing things.
00:32:18 [W] That's a great question.
00:32:21 [W] I think you know in my mind the old way was when we would rack up a thousand servers or start up a bunch of virtual machines, and then we would leverage tools to deploy some subset of our application to
00:32:31 [W] A subset of those nodes, right?
00:32:33 [W] And and with that old way we had all kinds of interesting challenges like, you know shared libraries and other problems that would that would be inherent when we were trying to couple different applications on two particular nodes and the new way, we we're dealing with containerd
00:32:48 [W] In with a very similar model in which we're dropping applications on to some subset of those nodes or running them as long time or long running processes just like we did before but the difference is that now, you know where some of the benefits of this new
00:33:03 [W] Come into play is that now we're actually giving each of those running processes their own view of the network their own view of the filesystem their own view of the pit namespace and these things mean that we actually have better
00:33:12 [W] Says because we can actually containerize them.
00:33:14 [W] This is effectively what container Rising is is basically just giving that running process its own isolated view of the world.
00:33:23 [W] And so I do think that that has improved security but it hasn't changed a too much as we look at the way that those processes interact with the colonel.
00:33:32 [W] Yeah, I think for me one of the big things about moving to communities and Cloud native has been this move to automation is beating this process of everything being, you know, automated and and infrastructure as code and that's kind of got trade-offs.
00:33:45 [W] It's got good things for security and it's got some things that are challenges.
00:33:48 [W] the good things for me. One of the big ones is about repeatability this idea that you know, I can take this code and I can create you know, 10 20 30 environments I want from you is a security test. It means I can say hey spin me up a new environment just for my test.
00:34:02 [W] And I can be confident that my findings, you know, they're going to be relevant in the same ones as you're going to see in production.
00:34:07 [W] So that's great.
00:34:08 [W] But the downside is that we have to think about things differently now, so we don't have pets servers anymore.
00:34:13 [W] We can't just load all our secrets up manually. We have to work out how we're going to store them and how we're going to manage them securely and that's one of the problems the new problems that we have to think about and also with everything being in the cloud, you know, we have to think well, everything's exposed.
00:34:26 [W] Everything is one step away from being compromised. So we have to be really careful with how we manage our information and access to things.
00:34:32 [W] Because it's all out there just sitting on the cloud.
00:34:34 [W] Being in the cloud, you know, we have to think well, everything's exposed.
00:34:33 [W] Everything is one step away from being compromised.
00:34:35 [W] So it'd be really careful with how we manage our information and access to things because it's all out there just sitting on the cloud.
00:34:42 [W] Yeah, I think there are a lot of benefits.
00:34:45 [W] I mean the moved in API driven infrastructure and configuration means that there's so many more opportunities to bake security improvements into the code.
00:34:54 [W] That is the source of Truth as opposed to say only being able to bolt it on later and those same apis make it much easier to query about those security settings at scale one, you know one place you clear everything you can see what the actual answer is,
00:35:09 [W] of a security policy or Miss configuration its present is probably present everywhere that makes it much easier to fix because it's all on a central spot and you can have it reliably take effect on the whole Fleet and that brings a lot less overall toil but
00:35:24 [W] The challenge is is finding that balance of velocity on automation versus complexity and security.
00:35:32 [W] So another question that we got asked is what are we think developers of upstream and downstream cloudevents ology should be thinking about from a security perspective.
00:35:43 [W] So as you all said a minute ago, I mean it's important to just notes in general for people who are building this kind of infrastructure.
00:35:51 [W] That what's old is new again, you know that a lot of these problems of like the old Tech that the shiny Cloud native wrapper is around haven't really quite been solved yet.
00:35:59 [W] So keep an eye on those but also you can't just assume that everything is the same. So keep an eye on that too. If you're building your first party data center in the cloud.
00:36:06 [W] It's probably going to be very expensive and not work exactly the way you think it will but also in general when you're looking at the systems that you
00:36:14 [W] I think it's really important to look at it from the perspective of an attacker because as an attacker, I'm going to be looking at your systems and I'm going to be looking at them in perhaps a different way than you might do.
00:36:25 [W] You actually know what's running in your environment.
00:36:28 [W] Do you actually know exactly what your code does and if you do know what your code does are you including the perspective of an attacker Persona in your user personas if you use those because when I'm looking at a system, I'm looking at it for things like where are the holes in?
00:36:43 [W] In this where are the trust boundaries?
00:36:45 [W] Room when you're building them and think about how an attacker might look at them and what that perspective might look like that can be really valuable and threat model accordingly because having a threat model is really important.
00:36:55 [W] Yeah, I like that and I will paraphrase another friend who says that one of the ways to think about, you know, increasing the security of your of your application or your environment is to think about what tools you might be leaving behind for those attackers
00:37:11 [W] I'd be leaving behind for those attackers and and one of the ways that I conceptualize this is by thinking about like what is packaged inside of a container image right that can't that whole container images going to ship and it's going to be running and it's going to be exposed to that long-running
00:37:19 [W] We're talking about earlier. Right and that means that anything that's inside of that container image will be available. If somebody were to get a reverse shell on that note now.
00:37:27 [W] I understand like the incredible power of having a debugging tool or bash or you know, SCP or any of these amazing tools that you could use to actually like get logs off of the running out of a container or understand what's
00:37:42 [W] Regular process or debugging things but at the same time and and many people actually will bundle these things into their container image because it might be come in handy later.
00:37:51 [W] But at the same time it may not come in handy for you and it may come and come in handy for anybody like even people who have or are working for Anna Faris purposes.
00:38:00 [W] The other thing I think that is useful is talking about these new containerd, you know, this container orchestration model we have to think about like, you know, what privilege has been granted to that process right like
00:38:12 [W] Is it running as a privilege container?
00:38:14 [W] Can it see all of the pins in the host name space?
00:38:17 [W] is it able to manipulate network interfaces? Is it able to do things like this and there's a ton of sharp edges and configurability in this especially with regard to things like kubernative.
00:38:27 [W] But yeah, you know what tools have you left behind? What have you left behind for your attackers is a great way to think about this.
00:38:34 [W] Another great question that came up for us was how do you go about evaluating the attack surface of a cluster on actually attacking it? Like where where do you even begin?
00:38:45 [W] Yeah, that's a really good one.
00:38:47 [W] So for me a lot of what I do focuses on things from a configuration standpoint. So I'll first look at the configuration of the external network and how access to the control plane in the nodes or configure and I'll kind of work my way in and I'll look at the configuration of
00:39:02 [W] environment like say how the cluster situated and what axis it has to other things and then I'm thinking about like the API server and just ruling out the obvious are back flaws like Anonymous secrets to you know access to Secrets or if there's any applicable see bees
00:39:15 [W] And it's sort of like stepping in further kind of like layers of the onion.
00:39:08 [W] I look at the configuration of the kubernative components the cloud credentials that are attached to the worker nodes and then sort of as a unit the combination of our back admission control network access control and container image
00:39:23 [W] And then sort of as a unit the combination of our back admission control network access control and container image contents kind of all is one thing to say, you know, what's the overall security posture of that giving workloads?
00:39:50 [W] that perspective
00:39:52 [W] Yeah, I think that ties a lot of with what we end up doing.
00:39:55 [W] I think when we end up doing security systems for customers, but we typically do is we'll take one of two approaches, you know, will either take this white box approach where we cannot give it access, you know will give it access to comb faced were given access to pull stuff down and they are a lot of what turns out to be happening is we end up doing
00:40:10 [W] Have two approaches, you know, well either take this white box approach where we cannot give an access, you know, we're giving access to calm things were given access to pull stuff down and they are a lot of what turns out to be happening is we end up doing data analysis building large quantities of Json down and parsing it and looking
00:40:25 [W] Sundowning parsing it and looking for patterns, you know, you got a lot of data to look at Automation and parsing is really important and you're looking for patterns that could indicate problems so could be cluster. Admin, you know, this this process runs is class for up and that's going to be dangerous.
00:40:39 [W] It's all going to be a target for me or other attackers.
00:40:41 [W] What about privilege containers is Duffy said before privilege containers can see all the processes they can get a lot more access.
00:40:47 [W] So what's in there that might be running is privileged. But then when we're doing the Black Box what we're doing is really trying to take that scenario and say Hey, you know, hey.
00:40:54 [W] Hey, I am a compromise container. You know, I've got access to this container.
00:40:59 [W] What can I do?
00:40:59 [W] Can I break out the sandbox?
00:41:01 [W] What rights do I have do I maybe have a dock or socket mounted inside my container and maybe where can I go on the network? So these two approaches but you're looking to the same kind of thing. You're looking for patterns of Badness?
00:41:12 [W] Yeah, totally what they said, you know, you want to look at like what exactly is going on in the environment that you're assessing like what's running in there? How is it running what level of privilege does it have?
00:41:24 [W] Is there anything that is potentially exploitable and then if you can get that then you kind of see how far you can go.
00:41:32 [W] Can you break out of the container?
00:41:33 [W] Can you break out of the node?
00:41:36 [W] Can you break out of the cluster itself and go into the cloud? It's really going to vary depending on what?
00:41:41 [W] You find but it's really a matter of like figuring out what's going on.
00:41:45 [W] Seeing how far you can get and a lot of it as y'all said is pattern recognition, but I want to note that if people are watching this who are new to this.
00:41:53 [W] Of us using a lot of pattern recognition to be discouraging to you because this isn't Magic.
00:41:58 [W] It isn't that where like Wizards who have Arcane knowledge that cannot be gained by other people.
00:42:03 [W] It's just that we've had a lot of practice and that's something that you can learn and practice to and for people who are excited about learning how to attack kubernative and this kind of thing.
00:42:11 [W] I want to encourage you to get your hands dirty go in and start practicing how to do that yourself a couple of great resources to do that are there's a workshop that happened at kubeacademy.
00:42:22 [W] Kane last year by Brad and some other awesome flux. You can find it at secure kubernative.com.
00:42:27 [W] It holds up very well with time and you can go all the way through it.
00:42:30 [W] There's also a CTF that happens periodically called honks ETL at one point.
00:42:34 [W] We played it as a team and it was pretty great and I believe that we want it.
00:42:37 [W] And so that's something to look out for and in general playing Capture the Flag games like ctfs not the kind of capture the flag that you played on the playground when you were a kid, but the kind that's like getting to like learn how to hack and sharpen your skills and learn
00:42:52 [W] To think like an attacker is something I really recommend that people do because it can be useful and it's also fun while we're on the subject of pattern recognition.
00:43:02 [W] Another question that we got that I'm going to throw to you. All is if somebody is a defender or a cluster administrator, what are some indicators that a cluster or kubernative environment has been compromised that people should look out for if there's a breach
00:43:17 [W] Is there something that people can see that happened?
00:43:22 [W] Yeah, you know going back to the answer about like how the kubernative security surface has changed.
00:43:29 [W] I think it actually highlights, you know, some of the complexity that we've introduced in this process as well.
00:43:33 [W] So let's think about like the old way and the new way and glue these things together.
00:43:37 [W] So the old way we would have, you know, a subset of our applications running on a subset of nodes and we might configure something like audit D to watch for behavior that we thought was not was not normal right and alert on that and then that would give us the ability to kind of understand that things were
00:43:52 [W] putting in our systems that we're not at that we were not expecting something you might not be expecting is something modifying or opening the file at the password right or the shadow file or any or other like secure, you know things that you would expect that
00:44:07 [W] Not an application would not do during normal experience.
00:44:12 [W] Well now in this new system as we as we described as we explore containerization, we have n number of etsy password files, right because each process has its own file system, right?
00:44:24 [W] And so that definitely adds a bit of complexity to the problem because now we actually have to understand, you know, which password file was attract or it was touched and which container was it running and is that still not normal?
00:44:37 [W] Allure is that okay, right, but understanding that normal behavior and like understanding how to do to detect it has changed. We can't just watch all of the file systems.
00:44:48 [W] We have to change the way we're watching for those things.
00:44:50 [W] There's a great project in the cncf umbrella called Falco and Falco basically operates at the syscall interface.
00:44:57 [W] so it's watching for system calls like file open or a grabbing a file handle on Etsy password against the Linux kernel
00:45:07 [W] And then maintaining the context so that you can understand which containerd has happened in and maintaining the context you can understand which container opened that Network socket and and really provides like a great Next Generation Oddity capability. So
00:45:22 [W] That's definitely how I would start.
00:45:25 [W] Yeah, I'll go with Duffy said about you know, getting visibility into what's happening inside. The containers for that malicious activity is like the primary source, like somebody could control exact or a shell was spawned, you know file connection like tough. He said
00:45:40 [W] Early indicators.
00:45:42 [W] I think the next best place to be looking are the audit logs.
00:45:45 [W] So, you know the API server audit logs and the neighboring Cloud API audit logs are really key in terms of getting that clear Smoking Gun evidence and while it might not be the first thing that captures the compromise.
00:46:00 [W] Probably going to capture a lot of the next steps that the attacker will take because they will most likely find valid credentials somewhere and try those credentials against those apis as they say, you know, can I expand my access inside the cluster
00:46:15 [W] Her privileged escalate or try to escape out into the nose or Escape out into the neighboring Cloud environment.
00:46:21 [W] for me, I think the one-two punch is is malicious activity detection logs and the audit logs in combination so you can really understand what just happened.
00:46:33 [W] So hopefully security incidents like that will continue to be relatively uncommon but one of the questions that might be helpful for cluster administrators to know more about is you know, how do you go about evaluating a project for its overall
00:46:48 [W] Security posture before you take the time to install it and integrate it into your own environment. Like what things are you looking for? And that'll throw that over to you guys?
00:46:58 [W] Yeah, that's a really great question.
00:46:59 [W] And I think obviously there are a huge number of projects in this space.
00:47:02 [W] So it's one you're going to have to spend some time on the first place. I would probably Luke is, you know the cncf security order, of course, you know, every graduated project has gotten older report on by third party. Those are great resources not just for like looking at code bugs, but also for looking at how the project you know, how
00:47:17 [W] What is security posture is like so that's a good starting point.
00:47:21 [W] I'll also tend to look at the websites, you know for each project and say do you have Security contact information, you know, do you are you encouraging secure to be able to get in touch and actually like get involved with the project and then the other place I tend to look is what's the happy path install like
00:47:36 [W] Of faults this project uses.
00:47:38 [W] Are they going to give you a secure installation?
00:47:39 [W] Because that's not tends to be two good indicator as well.
00:47:44 [W] For me, I want to know how exactly the thing works like technically.
00:47:49 [W] What are the details of like what exactly is it doing in there?
00:47:53 [W] What kind of privilege does it ask for?
00:47:55 [W] What kind of access does it need?
00:47:57 [W] Does it have readwrite access to the host to other machines like as an attacker?
00:48:04 [W] I know how I would want to potentially use something to break out of it.
00:48:07 [W] How viable is that? And in general if I'm using it from thinking about using it in my environment? How does it fit into my environment?
00:48:14 [W] What does it require to be connected to does it conflict with anything?
00:48:17 [W] And you know, what does it talk to and how does it fit into my threat model?
00:48:22 [W] Because it's really important as I said earlier to threat model your environment figure out what's in their figure out what's important to you and see if that project is going to fit into that larger goal.
00:48:34 [W] So I have a question for you. All speaking of larger goals.
00:48:37 [W] How do you find inspiration for where to honk next and how do you develop intuition about the emergent behavior of complex systems?
00:48:44 [W] I really like this question.
00:48:45 [W] I think it's fun.
00:48:45 [W] Yeah.
00:48:47 [W] it's a great question.
00:48:48 [W] I for my part.
00:48:49 [W] I think it's a I really maintain curiosity about everything the everything around me all the time.
00:48:55 [W] I'm done.
00:48:56 [W] I'm definitely one of those questioned everything types of people and I find that that's true.
00:49:03 [W] Not just in the way that I evaluate software or the video I evaluate systems but generally in life like I would look at an elevator and realize I'm going to be on this elevator, you know for 20 minutes of my day every day.
00:49:14 [W] So I wonder what else I can learn about this elevator right and might do this research on the type of elevator it is and see if there are any like, you know secret button pushes or tricks to actually opted to change.
00:49:25 [W] the behavior of this elevator into my benefit right like and so for my part, it's definitely curiosity stay curious, you know, like under, you know, take the time to explore that Curiosity and I know that we can all feel very rushed
00:49:40 [W] When we're doing our day-to-day job, but like that Curiosity and you should be celebrated and you know, take some time to maintain that.
00:49:49 [W] Absolutely, I think curiosity is a big part of it and for me like some of the best places I get kind of inspiration is from trying to answer people's questions, you know, seeing someone asked me a simple question go.
00:49:59 [W] That's a good point.
00:50:00 [W] How does that work?
00:50:01 [W] It's one of the things I do is I do a training course on containerd security and definitely some of my best inspiration has come from a question on that core say hey, how does that work?
00:50:09 [W] Oh that leaves me down a path and you know, there's other places places. Well, you know, you can go to stack Overflow or security stack exchange and try and answer the questions and doing that.
00:50:19 [W] Will lead you to interesting places could even lead to see these the other one.
00:50:23 [W] one. I like personally is I got to get a big issues right go to kubernative issues list filter by security just start reading the issues finding out what people are thinking about security and again that can lead to interesting places or even see these
00:50:36 [W] I'm also a big fan of reading GitHub issues and not just in the kubernative repository various kinds of dependencies different kinds of third-party components can have interesting questions that are positive there too because not everybody necessarily
00:50:51 [W] Looks like a security bug but often other bugs can be security bugs.
00:50:55 [W] So sometimes if you read between the lines in different kinds of issues of people being like I found this weird problem, what's up with that?
00:51:01 [W] Sometimes you can find interesting things there.
00:51:03 [W] I also really enjoyed reading the docks.
00:51:05 [W] A lot of project documentation can have interesting phrases in it. Like this can provoke unexpected Behavior.
00:51:12 [W] Do not use this in production.
00:51:13 [W] Please make sure to change these insecure defaults and things like that that when I see that I'm like that's interesting.
00:51:20 [W] NG what does this mean?
00:51:22 [W] And then I want to go Jason and poke at it inspiration can be found from all kinds of places. And personally, I'm excited about that unexpected behavior and those intersections and Corner cases of like what you don't think you're going to find but do so.
00:51:35 [W] Those are a lot of the time the things that I look for.
00:51:39 [W] Yeah curiosity.
00:51:40 [W] Definitely.
00:51:41 [W] I'm fortunate in that I always get to see a fair number of different setups and there's always something I haven't seen before. So I like to use that opportunity to get my hands on it. I have to see it running get it working and then sort
00:51:57 [W] Take survey of what it needs is the assumptions and design decisions that were made especially around those defaults. But I don't like sobbing there. You know, that might be you know job done, but that's where I think the fun just starts so I go right it poking and prodding.
00:52:12 [W] Trying to knock it over mess with its inputs and really see how it handles things when I'm really giving it things that it wasn't expecting. So all the time asking what if I do this what if I do that what if I give it that too much too little if I take that out like what
00:52:27 [W] Savior emerges so like a few months ago.
00:52:29 [W] I was poking at a container image manifest.
00:52:31 [W] Let's just take it out the digester like modifying the URL to fetch a layer from somewhere else and that just ended up triggering a CV in a container runtime.
00:52:40 [W] you know things like that that just kind of pop out of that immersion behavior is really where I like to go to dive in and get my hands dirty on.
00:52:48 [W] So we all have unique takes on how we find new things. But like what's an area that you all think is right for further hacking and exportation.
00:52:58 [W] Yeah, you know I think going back to like how we're changing things, you know, like how things are changed under containerd containerd orchestration.
00:53:04 [W] There is a ton of space that we haven't really spent a ton of time with yet. Right as we think about the way that we're building that isolation model, you know giving each process its own network news Pace or file system those sorts of things.
00:53:17 [W] This is actually implemented by container runtimes and there are several popular container runtimes that makes you wonder like are they all operating the same?
00:53:27 [W] Were they all designed with the same set of assumptions?
00:53:30 [W] I think if there's like a pretty rich space in those sorts of assumptions also things like system calls, right?
00:53:39 [W] Like I was talking about earlier with Falco watching at the Cisco layer to understand what's happening.
00:53:44 [W] The mapping of syscalls is different on the based on the architecture that you use so it would be different for x86 64 then it would be forearm and and I do think that like, you know in those models where we like make the assumption that perhaps we should be only operating under the
00:53:59 [W] Up.
00:53:59 [W] That's under x6c.
00:54:01 [W] x86 64 but this is now running on arm. So is it you know, are we still are we seeing a difference in Behavior those sorts of assumptions?
00:54:09 [W] I think really definitely highlight, you know a whole field of area the play with
00:54:15 [W] I think for me is all about these layers and all the different assumptions are being built up as we stopped over more and more layers, you know from the colonel up through Docker through kubenetes into things like servicemeshcon where those layers meet you get these kind of possibilities for
00:54:30 [W] you're sharp edges Corner cases stuff that could be followed and we're implementing a lot of protocols that are historically complicated things like HTTP, they're being security bugs of HTTP servers for decades now and also pki, you know kubernative makes a lot of
00:54:45 [W] CPI is traditionally a complex thing that has had a lot of security issues.
00:54:48 [W] So those are the kind of areas.
00:54:50 [W] I think are good in particular.
00:54:52 [W] I think where we ever see a new layer. So every new layer has a time to settle down and to work out what security looks like.
00:54:58 [W] So at the moment something like operators, you know, it's quite a new thing.
00:55:01 [W] It's there's a lot of activity there is a lot of development. So there's probably going to be opportunities to you know to poke at it some more and it's an area.
00:55:08 [W] think I'm probably more interested, you know over the next 12 months or so.
00:55:12 [W] Yeah for me. I've noticed a growing number of projects that are extending the kubernative API with custom resources. And that's to do things like create more clusters and even as like a new abstraction for managing other Cloud resources, and I think
00:55:28 [W] Anytime you give the data plane of one environment enough access and permissions to be the control plane of another environment.
00:55:35 [W] I think that's where things can really get interesting when those those layers intersect.
00:55:41 [W] Pressure and yeah, continuing the ongoing theme of layers, you know containers security is a holistic thing, right? Your container security is only as good as the security of the rest of your stack and for me thinking about the way that the
00:55:56 [W] Front parts of the stack cataract present a lot of exciting often unexplored attack surface.
00:56:00 [W] I'm really excited about Hardware attacks. I think Michael architectural techs are really interesting like meltdown inspector and their variants and I think that there is a lot of unexplored territory about how that can interact with things like multi-tenancy in the cloud.
00:56:14 [W] I'm also really excited one layer above about EPF as an attack surface.
00:56:20 [W] think that that is a very interesting unexplored territory where there's a lot of fun things that we haven't quite done yet.
00:56:25 [W] Yet so I feel excited about exploring that coming up and and just getting to explore all of the things because I think the cloud native space in general is so new.
00:56:38 [W] We're all exploring and building this stuff together.
00:56:40 [W] There's parts of the attack surface.
00:56:41 [W] We don't even know are there yet Perhaps because it hasn't been invented.
00:56:45 [W] So I'm super excited to be here at coupon Cloud knative con with everybody getting to build this future together and these Technologies together and I want to say thank you to all of you for
00:56:56 [W] Being here in building and exploring these features with us. If you want to be further involved in the kubernative project or the security of it.
00:57:06 [W] there's lots of work in kubernative to do and in the cncf landscape in general kubernative and a lot of these projects are open source.
00:57:13 [W] there's lots of work to be done. Lots of interesting problems to solve if you want to get involved kubernative has lots of special interest groups Sig's that do lots of different kinds of work.
00:57:23 [W] I'm the co-chair of security.
00:57:25 [W] We have lots of interesting problems to solve and we would love for you to get further involved. If you're interested. If you want to ask us questions or talk to us further, we're around you can find us on kubernative slack or discuss that k8s dot IO and we would love to be able to talk to you all and
00:57:41 [W] We're in a few together.
00:57:43 [W] Indeed and I also wanted to highlight again that like a lot of the questions that we answered during this am a panel came from the community and I wanted to give a shout out to everybody in the community who took the time to ask us your questions for this panel.
00:57:56 [W] We could not do this without your help.
00:57:59 [W] So thank you so much for putting up questions.
00:58:03 [W] And one more thing called the pilot Planet.
00:58:17 [W] Well, thank you Honker.
00:58:19 [W] I just thought the proper terminology.
00:58:20 [W] Thank you panel.
00:58:23 [W] I hope everyone will can't slack everyone seems to be really enjoying this panels of don't forget to else give this feedback on the content on the format. We really want to hear it's a sport for everyone.
00:58:33 [W] And also thank yous panel speakers those amazing amount of work of preparation and amazing delivery now for our next speakers.
00:58:40 [W] I want to introduce grad Shipley and Marissa Bush Grant is a senior director of developer experience at VMware. And Marissa is a program lead for the kubeacademy at VMware today.
00:58:52 [W] They will highlight how the community can advance knowledge of kubernative from getting started use cases all the way to Advanced deployments. Please welcome Grant and Marissa.
00:59:13 [W] Hello everyone.
00:59:14 [W] My name is Grant Shipley and I'm a senior director at VMware focused on kubernative as I'm down in my basement recording this short little keynote presentation.
00:59:24 [W] My kids are upstairs doing what most kids are doing today and that's online learning and that's what I'm here to talk to you about today. But let's start with the numbers now five years.
00:59:34 [W] Ago was the first-ever cube Khan and I was fortunate enough to be able to attend it during that conference.
00:59:40 [W] We had 510 attendees.
00:59:42 [W] Let's fast forward to 2020 to this specific event, and we have over 25,000 people registered and attending Cube con this year.
00:59:54 [W] We have been moving extremely fast during the last five years kubenetes has been adopted as the default platform for cloud native applications going forward and if you believe some of the numbers and analysts this was according to the IDC
01:00:09 [W] Future scape survey 500 million new applications will be developed over the next five years that is more than the last 40 years combined now the challenge with that though.
01:00:22 [W] is that according to stack overflows recent state of development survey 42% of all developers have less than five years of experience.
01:00:32 [W] so we need to be able to ensure that we embracing these new people into the community as they come up to speed.
01:00:39 [W] Don kubernative and that we have the tools and knowledge to be successful now VMware, we have a lot of kubernative.
01:01:09 [W] Turn it over to Marissa who's going to update you on some of the work that we have going on right now at VMware.
01:01:16 [W] Thanks Grant on the topic of making online learning better.
01:01:20 [W] I want to highlight kubeacademy.
01:01:21 [W] kubeacademy offers free online kubenetes training anyone can go to kubeacademy.com to take courses designed and delivered by experts. The course library is always expanding but right now we have 20 courses and more hours of training.
01:01:37 [W] Then the entire series of schitt's Creek.
01:01:41 [W] To give you a taste for the courses.
01:01:43 [W] Here's a great starting point for beginners.
01:01:45 [W] If you're new to kubernative East we recommend taking these three courses in order to help build your foundational knowledge.
01:01:53 [W] For those of you with a more intermediate skill level we have courses that will help get you ready for the CK exam.
01:01:59 [W] Of course that will walk you through options to get observability and your applications and systems. Of course that dives into kubenetes object types and many more
01:02:11 [W] We even have courses for experts to you can dive into the world of networking to understand the kubernative network model learn the design principles and components of the kubernative machine and get Hands-On with command line operations for Kube cuddle.
01:02:27 [W] You can even sign up for kubeacademy Pro for free to get interact to get access to interactive workshops and more in-depth content.
01:02:37 [W] These courses are led by the same individuals that are contributing to kubenetes and related open source projects.
01:02:43 [W] They're sharing what they've learned from hundreds of kubenetes deployments.
01:02:47 [W] And of course, they're creating these trainings for you.
01:02:49 [W] So they're always curious to hear which topics you would like them to cover next.
01:02:55 [W] If you're looking to contribute your own knowledge, you can join the faculty use this QR code to access an application form to become a cube Academy instructor.
01:03:07 [W] So if you're looking to advance your knowledge of kubenetes, you can go to kubeacademy.com today to start your first course.
01:03:17 [W] This can be any continues to lift each other up and sharing our knowledge is part of how we drive Kuma nineties and the cloud native ecosystem forward.
01:03:26 [W] And with that, thank you so much and enjoy the rest of Uconn.
01:03:35 [W] Thank you. Grant and Marissa, I think arguably the probably isn't such a thing as too little s**** Creek at least, you know, Nancy Stephen are pretty biased towards that but thank you for sharing that.
01:03:49 [W] Okay. Kubeacademy sounds really wonderful now our next presenter she'll is very familiar to all of you Liz rice Liz is a cncf Toc chair and vice president of open-source engineering at Aqua Security today.
01:04:03 [W] Give an update on the cloud native communities progress and where we might go from here for the per second perspective of the technical oversight committee Toc please welcome Liz rice.
01:04:33 [W] Hi, my name is Liz Wright, and I'm the chair of the cncf technical oversight committee.
01:04:40 [W] We're the group that steer the technical direction of the foundation and assess projects that apply to join or move up through sandbox and incubation to graduated level.
01:04:53 [W] This gives us a vantage point to see interesting Trends emerging from the cloud native world.
01:05:01 [W] So I want to take a few minutes today to talk about some of the changes. We want to focus on over the next year or so and share some predictions about the up-and-coming technology areas.
01:05:13 [W] We think will get more attention in 2021 and Beyond.
01:05:20 [W] This year we revamp the sandbox process making it much easier for projects to join at that level.
01:05:27 [W] But with the understanding that this is a space for experimentation and early stage collaboration.
01:05:34 [W] So here's our first prediction for 2021.
01:05:38 [W] We expect to see some sandbox projects failing and others consolidating or merging with other projects. This is an entirely healthy thing.
01:05:50 [W] If the cncf is going to support and encourage innovation in the cloud knative space, we have to expect some of the experiments to fail.
01:05:58 [W] Upon coming technology areas.
01:06:00 [W] we think will get more attention in 2021 and Beyond.
01:06:07 [W] This year we revamp the sandbox process making it much easier for projects to join at that level.
01:06:14 [W] But with the understanding that this is a space for experimentation and early stage collaboration.
01:06:22 [W] So here's our first prediction for 2021.
01:06:25 [W] We expect to see some sandbox projects failing and others consolidating or merging with other projects. This is an entirely healthy thing.
01:06:37 [W] If the cncf is going to support and encourage innovation in the cloud native space, we have to expect some of these experiments to fail.
01:06:45 [W] In fact, if all our sandbox projects make it to incubation that would suggest we haven't been experimental enough.
01:06:53 [W] Let's keep Cloud native innovative.
01:06:58 [W] At the other end of the maturity spectrum is graduation.
01:07:02 [W] A graduated project is one that we believe is ready for widespread adoption with little risk to an Enterprise that chooses to take it on.
01:07:14 [W] The current graduation criteria were drawn up at a time when moving to Cloud knative was a pretty cutting-edge thing for an Enterprise to do now we're seeing much wider adoption and we have many more
01:08:01 [W] knative innovative
01:08:04 [W] at the other end of the maturity spectrum is graduation.
01:08:08 [W] I graduated project is one that we believe is ready for widespread adoption with little risk to an Enterprise that chooses to take it on.
01:08:20 [W] The current graduation criteria were drawn up at a time when moving to Cloud knative was a pretty cutting-edge thing for an Enterprise to do now we're seeing much wider adoption and we have many more
01:08:35 [W] Sense for the TOC to take a look at the way we assess projects at incubation and graduation to make sure these definitions stay meaningful for everyone.
01:08:46 [W] We're absolutely sticking with the principles of no King makers and one size does not fit all but we think that as a community we can do an even better job of highlighting the best Solutions in
01:09:01 [W] Acres and one size does not fit all but we think that as a community we can do an even better job of highlighting the best Solutions in Cloud native and helping end users identify, which
01:09:19 [W] And helping end users identify which project is best for their particular circumstances.
01:09:27 [W] This also includes making sure that project governance is confidence inspiring as ever.
01:09:34 [W] We're not proposing to impose any particular form of governance. But we do want to provide advice and support for project leaders who might want help in this complex area.
01:09:47 [W] So another prediction the cncf will be able to provide additional support and ideas for governance models that work for contributors and users are like let's keep Cloud native well-governed.
01:10:04 [W] I feel on pretty safe ground on this next prediction.
01:10:07 [W] The number of projects involved will grow there will continue to be a ton of innovation and we'll see more community-driven collaborative projects joining the cncf +
01:10:23 [W] includes lots of vendors building complementary projects in the cloud knative space
01:10:22 [W] So that's cncf landscape.
01:10:24 [W] I'm looking forward to some downtime over the Christmas holidays with a nice jigsaw puzzle folks like to joke about the cncf landscape and how you need a microscope to read it, but in all seriousness
01:10:39 [W] Folks like to Jake about the cncf landscape and how you need a microscope to read it.
01:10:43 [W] But in all seriousness, there are lots of people who find it useful especially in its online form to find out about projects that might help solve a particular problem they have
01:10:57 [W] but I think we can do better to help users find their way around their options for a cloud native stack.
01:11:06 [W] I think I'm speaking not just for the TOC but also for the cncf staff when I say that creative ideas on this are welcome.
01:11:16 [W] So far I've talked about how we operate as an organization and a community, but now let's focus on the technology, which is what we get really excited about right working with my talented colleagues on the TOC.
01:11:31 [W] We came up with five emerging themes and technologies that we think are ones to watch in 2021.
01:11:39 [W] in no particular order
01:11:43 [W] we're seeing projects aiming to make resilience and Chaos engine earring easy to incorporate in your deployments.
01:11:51 [W] When your applications use many pluggable and Loosely coupled components, it's hard to test the resilience of the overall system.
01:12:00 [W] It seems likely that in the not-too-distant future.
01:12:03 [W] It will be common practice to use chaosmesh engineering to test how your applications handle failure scenarios and unexpected events.
01:12:13 [W] While many ngos is today are running their kubernative clusters.
01:12:17 [W] Holy located in data centers or the public Cloud.
01:12:22 [W] We're seeing more and more applications where notes or entire clusters operate at a physical distance.
01:12:29 [W] We are now hosting projects that explore various different models for running components distributed at the edge.
01:12:38 [W] It won't stop at orchestration will need other cloudevents.
01:12:43 [W] Knative components for the edge too.
01:12:47 [W] servicemeshcon
01:13:12 [W] webassembly Andy BPF will be hot Technologies in 2021.
01:13:18 [W] Well, those are essentially unrelated. They share some interesting characteristics like sandboxing high performance and customization the make them really applicable for use in solutions to a range of
01:13:33 [W] We're expecting to see a proliferation of projects to address the developer and operator experience.
01:13:37 [W] We need to make workflows that easier and allow developers to free themselves from the implementation details like yeah, Milland gitops.
01:13:49 [W] There's unlikely to be a single user experience that fits every use case.
01:13:54 [W] So we are fans of pluggable dashboards and extensible API driven you eyes we're seeing developer portals that make it easy to share common practices and tooling across organizations
01:14:09 [W] Schools built on top of Cloud native Technologies to take the idea of an integrated development environment to a whole new level and lower the barrier to contribution.
01:13:57 [W] I hope all the VCS and analysts have been taking notes.
01:14:00 [W] There's plenty of work to be done outside these areas.
01:14:05 [W] Do you remember two years ago in Seattle Janet quo described kubernative as very boring
01:14:13 [W] And she didn't mean that working on it was boring.
01:14:16 [W] She meant that it had moved into the mainstream.
01:14:20 [W] That's happening to more and more of our projects as they become mature and get adopted by lots of large organizations.
01:14:29 [W] There's tons of exciting and interesting work to be done to move Cloud native projects into the mainstream and keep Cloud native everywhere.
01:14:48 [W] Thank you, Liz.
01:14:49 [W] Let's give her a round of applause now. Our next speaker is Chris an effect.
01:14:57 [W] So I want everyone to welcome Chris Anna check the CTO of the Linux Foundation to present the cncf maintainer and Ambassador words of 2020.
01:15:05 [W] Hey everyone.
01:15:04 [W] It's a pleasure to be here live in Austin.
01:15:06 [W] It's just been amazing to have 23,000 people attending Cube con this time around.
01:15:13 [W] This is truly one of my favorite, you know activities for the conference, you know towards the tail end of this.
01:15:22 [W] Let me go to share my screen really quick so we can get started with the awards.
01:15:37 [W] Alrighty, so I am you know absolutely stoked to present these every year. It's been truly an honor to serve this community for the last five years really since you know Day Zero.
01:15:52 [W] I was talking to everyone, you know, slack Twitter and all these different communication mediums.
01:15:42 [W] You know, it really kind of dawned on me that you know Community is truly a precious thing.
01:15:49 [W] You know, I saw this tweet from Leia that you know, jokingly at most valuable conative Foundation project is our community and I somewhat agree.
01:15:57 [W] There's so many folks that do an amazing job ensuring that our community is welcome.
01:16:01 [W] Well above and beyond normal normal day-to-day.
01:16:06 [W] Leti so I'm just you know, totally share this sentiment and you know, thank everyone that goes above and beyond in making sure this is a welcome Place given especially how much we have grown over the years to encompassed different projects different
01:16:21 [W] Different countries and everything so it's kind of kick things off.
01:16:20 [W] Our first award to hand out is our top ambassador award.
01:16:26 [W] Our ambassadors are folks who represent, you know, the community and public through giving talks organizing events and so on if you see the previous list of Award winners here, we truly have
01:16:41 [W] Of an amazing set of folks from you know, Kelsey being the OG ambassador to Lucas if it was maybe like 17 at the time when he won that award to Sarah Michael and Lappy all these fantastic people for this time around.
01:16:49 [W] I'm excited that you know, the top Ambassador for 2020 is an amazing person.
01:16:58 [W] They have been promoting the you know, it's called The Art of improving climate of security across our
01:17:06 [W] System throughout the last couple years, so I would like to congratulate in cold water on winning this award this year.
01:17:17 [W] So hopefully we could go pop out and see her really quickly and she could leave.
01:17:36 [W] and
01:17:39 [W] oh, no.
01:17:40 [W] Alright, we had a bug.
01:17:46 [W] Joy
01:17:58 [W] We will move on wonderful intrado giving us wonderful issues today.
01:18:02 [W] So let's keep on rollin with our roads.
01:18:06 [W] Thank you negate they have been an amazing Ambassador for us also.
01:18:14 [W] Let's do it again.
01:18:17 [W] All right.
01:18:18 [W] we're back.
01:18:22 [W] I thank you again.
01:18:26 [W] All right. Our next set of awards are dedicated to top committers and maintainers.
01:18:33 [W] These are folks who have put forth and done an amazing job in the community in terms of supporting projects that are involved and we just have a fantastic set of folks that span the mid-eighties Prometheus in a variety of projects this year the
01:18:48 [W] Maintainer is existing containers have nominated a set of folks and decided to award the special honor to an elder from the communities Community.
01:19:00 [W] Not sure if any of you know been one of the primary authors of kind tool that I love and use quite quite often and is just one of the most helpful people in the community answering a variety of questions.
01:19:11 [W] So, let's see if we could pop up then onto our screen.
01:19:15 [W] All right.
01:19:18 [W] Hey, Ben. Alright now we're going to technical glitches are over get to see puppy and head.
01:19:24 [W] head. So, thank you Ben and thanks for all your contributions.
01:19:28 [W] All right, bring it back to our Awards.
01:19:33 [W] Sheriff perfect.
01:19:35 [W] Awesome.
01:19:35 [W] We're back.
01:19:36 [W] Thank you Ben our final set of awards which I think you know kind of our most important set of awards truly represent one of our values the most important values in the
01:19:51 [W] Chopping wood and carrying water for those of you who are not familiar phrase.
01:19:48 [W] These are essentially all the things that happen, you know behind the scenes from things like improving, you know, build times, you know performance generally not kind of feature facing work truly stuff that kind of keeps everything functional.
01:20:02 [W] We just had an amazing set of folks that have contributed over time in this and this year.
01:20:08 [W] year. I'm happy to announce our next slate of folks that have been nominated.
01:20:14 [W] Voted upon by both the cncf staff and our wonderful Toc so for 2020 we have Aaron Boyd Josh burkas Bridget, Matt and Richie, you know all fantastic human beings and
01:20:30 [W] On screen hopefully with their wonderful chop wood buckets and or it's good to see everybody loved it.
01:20:29 [W] Richie's the best.
01:20:30 [W] Yeah.
01:20:30 [W] So thank you everyone for all your work. And you know, I look forward to when we were able to see each other again face to face because truly all of you deserve to be on stage with over 20,000 people watching keynote also
01:20:45 [W] You know wrap wrap things up, you know, you know, I look forward to seeing everyone at the next Cube Khan and thank you for everyone who has participated in our communities. We do these awards every year and
01:20:56 [W] Do our best to make sure that folks that are welcome and do amazing things are recognized for their amazing work.
01:21:01 [W] So thank you all and look forward to seeing everyone next year. I'm gonna go hand it back to constants and Stephen to take us the end.
01:21:18 [W] Thank you, Chris.
01:21:19 [W] Thank you. Everyone for joining us this week Carol. I like do the puppy face before he walks away because he's not taking it anywhere. And I know he wants to sleep.
01:21:31 [W] There's like too much screen time.
01:21:32 [W] like I can't handle is popular, please everyone stop giving me all this attention on the internet. I direct a lot of it adoration. I'm going to share this quick anecdote before we actually do the official wrapping up Kota.
01:21:46 [W] Is known for ignoring people and so every time if you're to meet him in person, he will ignore you.
01:21:50 [W] So what he likes to do is he likes to maintain eye contact smile at you and as you pet goat a pet him, he does a 180 and purposely walks away.
01:21:57 [W] So like this attend like this Fame just gets to his head. It's really dangerous for both of us.
01:22:02 [W] But anyways, so while we wish we could have all been together in person.
01:22:08 [W] It's a fortunate situation that we're still able to come together, even if it's virtually so I want to thank everyone for participating in Twitter watching talk so many anynines.
01:22:16 [W] Recording talks.
01:22:14 [W] We know that if released from our personal experience.
01:22:18 [W] It is very hard to participate in this and so thank you everyone for putting in the energy and now I know of course because you know, we're all planning for the next one our next virtual Cuca knative Khan will be in Europe.
01:22:30 [W] It will be the year of chapter is happening May 4th through May 7th, 2021, and the cfps are open now.
01:22:37 [W] And so they're now please submit we want to see more cfps, and they're open until December 13th and sponsorships are still available.
01:22:47 [W] So I think you know by now that I really really love the community. One of my favorite parts of this conference is getting to see the community Awards.
01:22:58 [W] So just wanted to reiterate the shout out to everyone who who won an award everyone who is doing phenomenal work for all of the cloud native projects. You are my friends and family and I'm happy to work with all of you every day
01:23:13 [W] Is now join the keynote speakers within the keynote slack channel. So that's 2 Cube con Keynotes and we'll be hanging out for the next 15 minutes or so to answer any questions that you may have had.
01:23:22 [W] had. I know there's been like really wonderful this course throughout and lots of like high fives and waves and anecdotes and thank you, okay.
01:23:32 [W] And honkin ha ha ha.
01:23:37 [W] So the last set of breakout sessions will begin at through 10:00 eastern time.
01:23:43 [W] Yeah, and that's that's almost it.
01:23:46 [W] That's all right.
01:23:47 [W] Thank you for yeah. Thank you for joining us.
01:23:50 [W] Yeah.
01:23:51 [W] Thank you everyone.
01:23:59 [W] Our job is to make kubernative easier and easier and easier to use either from an Ops point of view or developer point of view while acknowledging it is complex because we're solving a complex problem.
01:24:58 [W] Kubernative will be boring as soon as we can make it boring.
01:25:01 [W] Maybe after I retire it's already boring.
01:25:05 [W] So I think we're well on our journey towards kubernative being boring.
01:25:08 [W] It'll only be boring when it's done.
01:25:10 [W] It'll only be done when it's no longer relevant.
01:28:47 [W] our job is to make kubermatic easier and easier and easier to use either from an Ops point of view or developer point of view while acknowledging it is complex because
01:28:56 [W] We're solving a complex problem.
01:29:57 [W] Kubernative will be boring as soon as we can make it boring.
01:30:00 [W] Maybe after I retire it's already boring.
01:30:03 [W] So I think we're well on our journey towards kubernative being boring.
01:30:07 [W] It'll only be boring when it's done.
01:30:09 [W] It'll only be done when it's no longer relevant.
